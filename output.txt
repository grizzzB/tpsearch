2268922|t|[Effect of si jun zi tang on the macrophage cytotoxic activity in mice].
2268922|a|The effect of Si Jun Zi Tang (SJZT) on the activities of peritoneal macrophage (M phi) mediated MTC and ADCC in normal and immunosuppressed mice were examined by isotope releasing assay (51Cr, 125I-UdR). The results showed the SJZT no significantly increased peritoneal M phi-mediated cytotoxic activity (MTC, ADCC) in normal mice. After the injection of immuno-depressive cyclophosphamide (Cy) alone (ip), the cytotoxic activities were decreased, but by treatment with Cy and SJZT, the cytotoxic activities were significantly increased compared with Cy group, the enhancing rates amounted to 74.40% (M phi-MTC) and 121.03% (M phi-ADCC) respectively. It was demonstrated that the SJZT could protest against the effect that the Cy inhibited the activities of MTC and ADCC of peritoneal M phi in mice, but there was no significant effect on normal mice. It indicated that the function of SJZT's immunoregulation was related to the state of immune in body.

18600032|t|Saireito and saikosaponin D prevent urinary protein excretion via glucocorticoid receptor in adrenalectomized WKY rats with heterologous-phase anti-GBM nephritis.
18600032|a|AIMS: In order to clarify the antinephritic mechanisms of saireito, the glucocorticoid receptor agonistic effect of saireito was evaluated in adrenalectomized rats with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) nephritis. METHODS: Rats with anti-GBM nephritis were subjected to adrenalectomy to exclude the effects of endogenous steroid hormones to investigate effects of saireito on the nephritis. The suppressive effects of saireito and saikosaponin D on the production of cytokines were investigated in vitro andin vivo. RESULTS: Administration of saireito or saikosaponin D significantly suppressed the increase of urinary protein excretion and histopathological changes in adrenalectomized nephritic rats. Coadministration of saireito or saikosaponin D and RU-38486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, did not suppress the increase of urinary protein excretion. Saikosaponin D inhibited the glucocorticoid receptor binding of [(3)H]dexamethasone in anin vitro assay (IC(50) ratio 5.8 micromol/l). The IC(50) values of saikosaponin D for the release of IL-2 and IL-10 were 13.4 and 12.3 micromol/l, respectively. Administration of saireito and saikosaponin D prevented an increase in IL-2 levels in the renal cortex of anti-GBM nephritic rats. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the antinephritic effects of saireito may be partly attributable to an agonistic action on the glucocorticoid receptor by saikosaponin D, a component of saireito.

18085387|t|Saireito probably prevents mesangial cell proliferation in HIGA mice via PDGF-BB tyrosine kinase inhibition.
18085387|a|BACKGROUND: In this study, we administered saireito to high serum IgA (HIGA) mice and investigated its inhibitory effect on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (which causes mesangial proliferation) as one of the possible antinephritic mechanisms of saireito. METHODS: Female HIGA/NscSlc mice, aged 10 weeks, were divided into five groups (each, n = 12; a control group, three saireito-mixed feed groups, and a captopril-mixed feed group) so that the plasma IgA levels were comparable among the groups. After the grouping, the animals were administered the saireito or captopril, mixed in the feed, until the age of 45 weeks. RESULTS: At the age of 45 weeks, the glomerular cell number was 47.8 +/- 3.9 / cross section in the HIGA mice in the control group, but 41.6 +/- 2.3 / cross section in the 1.3% saireito-mixed feed group and 38.7 +/- 3.5 / cross section in the captopril-mixed feed group, being significantly lower in both these treatment groups than in the control group. At the age of 45 weeks, the sclerosis score in the HIGA mice in the control group was 0.92 +/- 0.23. However, the sclerosis scores in the 0.26% (0.59 +/- 0.26) and 1.3% (0.58 +/- 0.16) saireito-mixed feed groups were significantly lower than that in the control group. In the captopril-mixed feed group, the sclerosis score was 0.64 +/- 0.34, significantly lower than that in the control group. It was clarified that saireito suppressed mesangial cell proliferation without showing any cytotoxicity. Furthermore, as a result of investigating the mesangial cell proliferation-suppressing effect similarly with the 23 substances constituting saireito, a proliferation-suppressing effect was recognized with isoliquiritigenin (a component of Glycyrrhizae Radix) and oroxylin A (a component of Scutellariae Radix). Oroxylin A and isoliquiritigenin showed an inhibitory effect on PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of oroxylin A and isoliquiritigenin on tyrosine kinase were found to be specific to the PDGF receptor, and showed no influence on the tyrosine kinase activities of other growth-factor receptors examined. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the antinephritic effects of saireito in HIGA mice may be partly due to the inhibiton of PDGF tyrosine kinase by oroxylin A and isoliquiritigenin, components of saireito.

25754438|t|Japanese Kampo Saireito Has a Liver-Protective Effect Through the Inhibition of Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase Induction in Primary Cultured Rat Hepatocytes.
25754438|a|UNASSIGNED: Background: Japanese herbal medicine, Kampo saireito, is used for treatments in patients with digestive diseases, including chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. However, few studies demonstrate scientific evidence for liver-protective effects of saireito. In inflamed liver, proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b stimulate the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production. Excessive levels of NO synthesized by iNOS have been implicated as one of the factors in liver injury, so it is essential to reduce the induction of iNOS for the prevention of liver injury. In this study, we examined IL-1b-stimulated hepatocytes as a simple "in vitro injury model" to investigate liver-protective effects of saireito. Method: Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with IL-1b in the presence or absence of saireito. The induction of NO production and iNOS and its signaling pathway were analyzed. Results: Saireito inhibited the production of NO dose and time dependently and reduced the expression of iNOS messenger RNA (mRNA) and its protein. Saireito had no effect on IkB degradation but inhibited the translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB to the nucleus and its DNA binding. Saireito also inhibited the activation of Akt, resulting in the reduction of type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) mRNA and protein expression. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that saireito suppresses iNOS gene expression through the inhibition of NF-kB and IL-1RI-dependent pathways, leading to the reduction of NO production. Saireito may have therapeutic potential for organ injuries, including liver.

9625448|t|Saireito (a Chinese herbal drug) decreases inhibitory effect of prednisolone and accelerates the recovery of rat hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
9625448|a|Saireito, a saiko agent (a Chinese herbal drug), increases the synthesis and secretion of ACTH by stimulating hypothalamic CRH release. In the present study, we examined the effect of food containing saireito (1.5%) on the recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis after treating male rats with prednisolone (PSL, 200 microM) in drinking water for 14 days. Saireito was administered during and after PSL administration. The rats were decapitated at various times after PSL administration. Tail-pinch stress had been applied to some rats. The plasma ACTH response to tail-pinch stress in the PSL + saireito group recovered to the control level on day 1, but that in the group given PSL alone recovered on day 3. The ACTH level in the anterior pituitary and the CRH level in the median eminence of the PSL + saireito group returned to the control level on day 3, and that in the group given PSL alone returned to it on day 5. These results indicate that the administration of saireito reduces the negative feedback effect of PSL on the hypothalamus and pituitary and accelerates the recovery of the hypothalamic CRH and pituitary ACTH level after glucocorticoid treatment.

20423219|t|Discrepancy between clinical course and drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests in a case of saireito-induced liver injury accompanied by Sj  gren syndrome.
20423219|a|BACKGROUND: Saireito consists of components of shosaikoto and goreisan. There are several reports of liver injury caused by shosaikoto and saireito, whereas cases caused by goreisan are rarely seen. PATIENT: A 70-year-old woman suffered from sicca of the eyes and oral cavity that arose in 2003. In June 2004, we diagnosed her as having Sj  gren syndrome on the basis of Schirmer's test, salivary scintigraphy, presence of anti-SS-A/Ro antibody, and subjective symptoms. Although a muscarinic agonist was commenced, her sicca symptoms did not improve. INTERVENTIONS: In February 2008, 7.5 g/day of shosaikoto extract granules (for ethical use, Tsumura _ Co., Tokyo, Japan) was introduced. Her symptoms and laboratory data did not change. The next month, the treatment was replaced by 9.0 g/day of saireito extract granules (for ethical use, Tsumura _ Co., Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS: After 10 weeks, elevation of liver enzymes was observed. On suspicion of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), saireito was withdrawn, and the patient's liver enzymes returned to normal the next month. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests (DLSTs) for saireito, shosaikoto, and goreisan were all positive. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course suggested allergy to the goreisan component of saireito. It is important to be aware of the limitation of DLST as a diagnostic tool for DILI, especially for herbal medicines.

25565296|t|Saireito (TJ-114), a Japanese Traditional Herbal Medicine, Reduces 5-Fluorouracil-Induced Intestinal Mucositis in Mice by Inhibiting Cytokine-Mediated Apoptosis in Intestinal Crypt Cells.
25565296|a|UNASSIGNED: Clinical chemotherapy frequently causes intestinal mucositis as a side effect, which is accompanied by severe diarrhea. We recently showed that the cytokine-mediated apoptotic pathway might be important for the development of intestinal mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Saireito, the traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine, is widely used to treat diarrhea and various inflammatory diseases in Japan. In the present study, we investigated the effect of saireito on 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis in mice, especially in relation to apoptosis in the intestinal crypt. Male C57BL/6 mice were given 5-FU (50 mg/kg), i.p. once daily for 6 days. Intestinal mucositis was evaluated histochemically. Saireito (100-1000 mg/kg) was administered p.o. twice daily for 6 days. Repeated 5-FU treatment caused severe intestinal mucositis including morphological damage, which was accompanied by body weight loss and diarrhea. Daily administration of saireito reduced the severity of intestinal mucositis in a dose-dependent manner. Body weight loss and diarrhea during 5-FU treatment were also significantly attenuated by saireito administration. The number of apoptotic and caspase-3-activated cells in the intestinal crypt was increased, and was accompanied by up-regulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b mRNA within 24 h of the first 5-FU injection. However, all of these measures were significantly lower after saireito administration. These results suggest that saireito attenuates 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. This action may come from the reduction of apoptosis in the intestinal crypt via suppression of the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, saireito may be clinically useful for the prevention of intestinal mucositis during cancer chemotherapy.

23861700|t|Therapeutic effects of saireito (chai-ling-tang), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, on lymphedema caused by radiotherapy: a case series study.
23861700|a|Despite the development of radiotherapy machines and technologies, a proportion of patients suffer from radiation-induced lymphedema. Saireito (SRT) is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that has been used for treating edema and inflammation in conditions such as nephritic disease. This study investigated the effect of SRT on lymphedema caused by radiotherapy. Four patients were treated with SRT at a dose of 9   g/day. The severity of lymphedema was evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 and Numerical Rating Scale before and after SRT treatment. After the treatment with SRT, 2 of 4 patients (50%) showed apparent improvement in lymphedema. One of the cases had difficulty in wearing the custom-made thermoplastic cast, but after SRT administration, he could wear the mask easily. One case decided to stop taking SRT 3 days after initiation because cough and fever appeared. In conclusion, it is important to control the side effects of radiotherapy, which leads to improved tumor control rates. Prospective randomized studies are necessary to confirm the findings of this case series study.

20045953|t|The inhibitory effect of ergosterol, a bioactive constituent of a traditional Japanese herbal medicine saireito on the activity of mucosal-type mast cells.
20045953|a|Mucosal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) is presumed to be regulated primarily by type 2 T helper cell immune responses and mucosal mast cells in the colon are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the mucosal inflammation. Saireito, a Japanese herbal medicine of standardized quality, originating from traditional Chinese medicine (Kampo medicine), is composed of two different Kampo medicines (shosaikoto and goreisan) and is often used for UC in Japan. In this study, we examined the direct effects of these Kampo medicines and their constituents on the antigen-induced degranulation of mucosal-type mast cells. Mucosal-type murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMCs) were pretreated by these drugs for 24 h, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor-triggered degranulation of mBMMCs was assessed by beta-hexosaminidase release. Goreisan showed inhibitory effects on degranulation of mBMMCs in a dose-dependent manner. Among the five constituent medicinal herbs of goreisan, Poria and Polyporus had the inhibitory effects on mBMMCs. Ergosterol, a principal and common component of Poria and Polyporus, also suppressed the degranulation of mBMMCs. Our results provide a molecular basis to explain a portion of the beneficial therapeutic properties of saireito on UC.

19752563|t|The traditional herbal medicine saireito exerts its inhibitory effect on murine oxazolone-induced colitis via the induction of Th1-polarized immune responses in the mucosal immune system of the colon.
19752563|a|BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis is an intractable inflammatory colonic disease, and its etiology remains unclear. Saireito, a traditional herbal medicine, is widely used for treating ulcerative colitis in Japan. We analyzed the immunological characteristics of an oxazolone (OXZ)-induced colitis (OC) model and examined the effects of sareito on this model. METHODS: OXZ was injected into the colon of BALB/c mice. Saireito was orally administered once a day for 3 consecutive days. Colitis was assessed by scoring the symptoms and macroscopic findings. The transcription patterns in the middle colon and spleen were analyzed with global transcriptome analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The above-mentioned scores were increased in the OC mice. The transcription levels of Th2 cytokines were significantly upregulated in the spleen and middle colon of the OC mice, whereas those of the Th1 cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma decreased in the spleen and increased in the middle colon. Saireito significantly ameliorated OC. In the middle colon of the saireito-treated mice, enhanced expression of Th2 cytokine mRNAs was markedly downregulated, while that of IFN-gamma mRNA was further upregulated. In contrast, in the spleen, saireito had no effect on the transcription of either type of cytokine. After global transcriptome analysis, real-time PCR analysis revealed that saireito greatly downregulated the enhanced expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 mRNA in the middle colon of OC mice. CONCLUSIONS: Saireito exhibits inhibitory effects on OC by the induction of Th1-polarized immune responses in the mucosal immune system of the colon.

17597500|t|Anti-inflammatory effect of dohongsamultang through inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with cerebral infarction.
17597500|a|The Korean indigenous medicine "Dohongsamultang (DHSMT)" has long been used for various cerebrovascular diseases. However, the exact mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of DHSMT is not completely understood. The aim of the present study is to elucidate how DHSMT modulates the inflammatory reaction in lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells from cerebral infarction (CI) patients. Production and expression of cytokine was measured via the ELISA and RT-PCR methods. The level of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)/Rel A protein and NF-kappaB DNA binding activity were determined via the Western blot analysis and transcription factor enzyme-linked immunoassay. It showed that DHSMT inhibited the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 induced by LPS in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). The maximal inhibition rates for TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 production by DHSMT were about 50.18%, 32.13%, and 38.03%, respectively. DHSMT inhibited the TNF-alpha mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. We also showed that the inhibitory effect of DHSMT is through the suppression of the NF-kappaB pathway. The study suggests an important molecular mechanism by GMGHT to reduce inflammation, which might explain its beneficial effect in the regulation of inflammatory reactions.

9288367|t|The effects of ninjinyoeito on cultured venous endothelial cells.
9288367|a|The effects of Ninjinyoeito on endothelial cells in human umbilical veins was examined. We found that Ninjinyoeito accelerates the inhibition and decomposition of Endothelin-1 production, which is known to constrict veins and raise blood pressure, and promote the synthesis of nitric oxicide which is known to have a vasophypotonic effect. We also found that Ninjinyoeito accelerates Interleukin 1-beta (IL-1 beta) production. IL-1 beta is a substance that plays important roles in maintaining the homeostasis of living organisms in immunity and inflammation, for example, as well as in the production of tissue plasminogen activators, which are known to have an anti-thrombotic effect on blood coagulation and on the fibrinolysis mechanism. Thus, it is suggested that Ninjinyoeito is effective in accelerating the physiological functions of human vein endothelial cells in vitro.

8135173|t|The effects of ninjinyoeito on human vascular endothelial cells.
8135173|a|The effects of Ninjinyoeito on endothelial cells from a human umbilical vein were examined. As a result, the maximum cell density obtained after the addition of Ninjinyoeito was found to be 400 ng/ml, and its inhibitory effect on the development of endothelial injury was also observed. In addition, the levels of LDH and Al-p, which are parameters decreasing with aging, were significantly high. Judging from these results, Ninjinyoeito presumably exerts an anti-aging effect by inhibiting the metabolic aging of cells.

7872241|a|We studied the effect of Ninjinyoeito in relation to the endothelial cells of the human aorta. Ninjinyoeito produced a cell proliferation acceleration effect, resulting in suppression of the synthesis and acceleration of the disintegration of endothelin, which acts as a vasoconstrictor and vasopressor. Also, acceleration of the synthesis of prostacyclin, which shows antithrombosis and platelet coagulation suppressing effects, was observed. The results suggest that Ninjinyoeito accelerates physiological function of in vitro human aorta endothelial cells.

12230021|t|The improvement of luteal insufficiency in fecund women by tokishakuyakusan treatment.
12230021|a|The effect of tokishakuyakusan, a Chinese herbal medicine, was examined, in vivo, in women with luteal insufficiency and in women with normal menstrual cycles. Luteal insufficiency was determined by daily measurement of basal body temperature and plasma progesterone levels. Tokishakuyakusan improved luteal insufficiency. Furthermore, the effects of tokishakuyakusan on prolactin, gonadotropins, steroids, angiotensin II, ANP and renin levels in the blood of women with normal menstrual cycles were studied, as were the medicine's effects on estrogens, pregnenediol and LH in the urine of the same women. Tokishakuyakusan had no adverse effect on hormonal levels in either blood or urine. Furthermore, no clinical side effects were detected. These results suggest that tokishakuyakusan improves luteal insufficiency in women but does not affect the hormonal levels of women with normal menstrual cycles.

1767796|a|The presence of endothelin-1 (ET) and effect of Tokishakuyakusan (TS) on ET in rat corpora lutea (CL) was investigated in superovulated ovaries, induced with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin. A high concentration of ET was found in the CL. The level of ET was significantly lower in the CL from TS-treated rats than that in TS-untreated rats (402.68 versus 575.60 pg/g wet weight, p less than 0.05). In contrast, the ET levels in plasma were by far lower than those in CL. These data indicate an inhibitory effect of TS on ET, an intraovarian peptide, production or accumulation in the CL.

1816728|a|The effect of Tokishakuyakusan (TS) on the corpus luteum function in pseudopregnant rats was examined in vivo. On day 4 of pseudopregnancy (PSP), induced by cervical stimulation, TS (20 micrograms) stimulated the progesterone secretion rate (PSR) in the ovarian venous plasma. There was also a significant increase in the rate of progesterone to 20 alpha-OH-progesterone. However, on day 8 of PSP, there was no apparent change in PSR in the ovarian venous plasma after the administration of TS. These data suggest that the sensitivity to TS of the corpus luteum varies according to its age.

24648849|a|Objectives. To identify the correlates of headaches in middle-aged women and investigate the effects of Tokishakuyakusan (TJ-23), a formula of traditional Japanese herbal therapy Kampo, on headache and concomitant depression. Methods. We examined cross-sectionally the baseline records of 345 women aged 40-59 years who visited our menopause clinic. Among them, 37 women with headaches were treated with either hormone therapy (HT) or TJ-23; the data of these women were retrospectively analyzed to compare the effects of the treatment. Results. The women were classified into 4 groups on the basis of their headache frequency, and no significant intergroup differences were noted in the physical or lifestyle factors, except age. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the significant contributors to the women's headaches were their age (adjusted OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.97)) and their depressive symptoms (adjusted OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.39-2.16)). Compared to women treated with HT, women treated with TJ-23 reported relief from headaches (65% versus 29%) and concomitant depression (60% versus 24%) more frequently. Improvement in the scores of headaches and depression correlated significantly with TJ-23 treatment. Conclusions. Headache in middle-aged women is significantly associated with depression; TJ-23 could be effective for treating both of these symptoms.

24872835|t|The traditional kampo medicine tokishakuyakusan increases ocular blood flow in healthy subjects.
24872835|a|The aim of this study was to examine the effects of oral administration of kampo medical formulas on ocular blood flow (OBF). A crossover protocol was used to randomly administer five grams of yokukansan, tokishakuyakusan (TSS), keishibukuryogan, or hachimijiogan to 13 healthy blinded subjects (mean age: 37.3    12.3 years). The mean blur rate, a quantitative OBF index obtained with laser speckle flowgraphy, was measured at the optic nerve head before and 30 minutes after administration. Blood pressure (BP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were also recorded. No significant changes were observed in mean BP or IOP after the administration of any of the kampo medical formulas. There was a significant increase in OBF 30 minutes after administration of TSS (100% to 103.6    6.9%, P < 0.01). Next, TSS was administered to 19 healthy subjects (mean age: 32.0    11.0 years) and OBF was measured before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after administration. Plain water was used as a control. OBF increased significantly after TSS administration compared to control (P < 0.01) and also increased from 30 to 60 minutes after administration compared to baseline (P < 0.05). These results suggest that TSS can increase OBF without affecting BP or IOP in healthy subjects.

1897491|a|Twenty-seven-day old female rats received 20 IU PMS and 56 hours later, 40 IU hCG. Seven days after hCG treatment, the resected ovaries were incubated in vitro with herbal components of Tokishakuyakusan (TS). Mixture of hoelen + peony root + alisma rhizone + Japanese angelica root or hoelen + Japanese angelica root or Japanese angelica root + cnidium rhizome significantly increased progesterone secretion, and these levels tended to exceed the level by TS alone. These results suggest an exquisitely blended effect of herbal components of TS on progesterone secretion by corpora lutea.

ET-1 levels during and/or after TS or KB treatment had no significant changes when compared with those in TS- or KB-untreated women. These results suggest that TS or KB has no effects on the ET-1 level during the menstrual cycle, gestation and the post-partum period.

2270849|a|The effect of Tokishakuyakusan (TS) and Keishibukuryogan (KB) on estradiol-17 beta, progesterone and testosterone in serum and ovarian tissue from PMS-treated immature rats was examined in vivo. The in vivo intravenous administration of 20 micrograms of TS or KB increased the concentrations of estradiol-17 beta, progesterone and testosterone. These results suggest that TS and KB stimulate in vivo the production of estradiol-17 beta, progesterone and testosterone by preovulatory follicles, and that TS stimulation is more effective than KB.

3425568|a|27-day-old rats received 20 IU of PMS subcutaneously, and 56 hours later, 40 IU of hCG to induce superovulated ovaries. Seven days after the hCG treatment, the ovaries were resected and incubated or perifused with an extract of Hachimijiogan (TJ-7), Tokishakuyakusan (TJ-23) or Keishibukuryogan (TJ-25). Progesterone in media was assayed by radioimmunoassay. In the incubation study, TJ-23 significantly (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.05) increased progesterone concentrations, while TJ-7 or TJ-25 showed no remarkable effect. In the perifusion study, TJ-23 or TJ-25 augmented progesterone levels, whereas TJ-7 revealed no effect. These results suggest that TJ-23 or TJ-25 stimulates the corpus luteum to secrete progesterone.

19332457|t|A chinese herbal medicine, tokishakuyakusan, reduces the worsening of impairments and independence after stroke: a 1-year randomized, controlled trial.
19332457|a|In post-stroke patients, the recurrence of stroke and progression of impairments lead to a bedridden state and dementia. As for their treatments, only anti-hypertension and anti-coagulation therapies to prevent the recurrence of stroke are available. In Asia, post-stroke patients with impairments are often treated with herbal medicine. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of tokishakuyakusan (TS) in improving the impairment and independence in post-stroke patients. Thirty-one post-stroke patients (mean age   =   81.4 years) were recruited and enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to the TS group (n = 16) or non-treatment (control) group (n = 15) and treated for 12 months. Impairments were assessed using the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS). Independence was evaluated using the functional independence measure (FIM). For each outcome measure, mean change was calculated every 3 months. The results were that impairments according to SIAS did not significantly change in the TS group. In contrast, SIAS significantly worsened in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups. In each term of SIAS, affected lower extremity scores, abdominal muscle strength, function of visuospatial perception, and so forth. in the TS group were better than those in the control group. Independence according to FIM did not change significantly in the TS group. In contrast, FIM significantly worsened in the control group. There was also a significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, TS was considered to suppress the impairments of lower limbs and to exert a favorable effect on cerebral function for post-stroke patients.

1897493|a|Ovarian follicles, removed from 10-week old rats at 1630 hours diestrus-2, 1100 and 2300 hours proestrus, were incubated for 120 minutes with various doses of Hachimijiogan (HJ), Tokishakuyakusan (TS), Keishibukuryogan (KB), Ninjinto (NT) and Unkeito (UT). The estradiol-17 beta (E2) and progesterone concentrations in the incubation medium were measured. The concentrations of E2 were significantly decreased with TS and KB by growing follicles and with HJ, TS and KB by preovulatory follicles before a LH surge. In contrast, the levels of progesterone were significantly increased with HJ, TS, KB and UT by preovulatory follicles before a LH surge. These results suggest that HJ, TS, KB or UT stimulates preovulatory follicles before a LH surge to secrete progesterone, but TS or KB suppresses E2 secretion by growing preovulatory follicles before a LH surge.

1534963|a|We have previously shown the presence in a high concentration of endothelin-1 (ET) in the corpus luteum and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and binding sites for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the ovarian follicle. The present study was undertaken to identify the existence of ET, renin, angiotensin II and the binding site for ANP in the ovary at proestrus and examine in vivo the effects of herbal medicines [Tokishakuyakusan (TS), Keishibukuryogan (KB), Shakuyakukanzoto (SK) and Unkeito (UT)] on them. ET, all components of RAS and binding sites for ANP were found at high levels in the ovary. TS, KB, SK and UT decreased the ET levels in ovary, while components of RAS and binding sites for ANP have the propensity to increase. However, ET, renin, angiotensin II and ANP levels in plasma were not at all affected before and after treatment with TS, KB, SK or UT. Taken together with previous observations showing the existence of ET, RAS and the binding site for ANP in the ovary, we propose here the ERAANPS (endothelin-renin-angiotensin-ANP system) in the ovary as a functional regulator. Further, these results suggest that TS, KB, SK or UT may regulate the ovarian ERAANPS.

1605131|t|Effects of tokishakuyakusan, keishibukuryogan and unkeito on DNA polymerase alpha activity in uteri of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin-treated immature rats.
1605131|a|To provide some insights how herbal medicines affect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis in the uterus, the DNA polymerase activities (alpha and beta) in uterine samples taken from rats were measured. DNA polymerase alpha activity with respect to DNA content revealed alpha cyclic change with the highest level on proestrus, while DNA polymerase beta activity showed no significant changes during the estrous cycle. The increased period of the activity coincided with that of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) but not progesterone (P4) in the blood. Injection of 10 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMS) on day 27 of age gradually increased DNA polymerase alpha activity in uteri, while concomitant treatment with PMS and 200 micrograms Tokishakuyakusan (TS), Keishibukuryogan (KB) or Unkeito (UT) suppressed the enzyme activity, with a most remarkable effect of KB. These results suggest that TS, KB or UT suppresses in vivo DNA polymerase alpha activity induced by PMS in the rat uterus.

3425577|a|27-day-old female rats received 20 IU PMS and 56 hours later, 40 IU hCG and were orally given with 20 or 200 micrograms of Hachimijiogan (TJ-7), Tokishakuyakusan (TJ-23) or Keishibukuryogan (TJ-25) daily for 3 or 5 days before sacrifice. Seven days after hCG treatment, the serum and ovarian tissue were assayed for progestins. 200 micrograms/day of TJ-23 significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased the progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone levels, whereas it significantly (p less than 0.01) increased 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. TJ-7 and TJ-25 showed a tendency to decrease these progestins. These results suggest that TJ-23 has a luteolytic effect on the corpus luteum in vivo.

27006676|t|The Difference between the Two Representative Kampo Formulas for Treating Dysmenorrhea: An Observational Study.
27006676|a|In Kampo medicine, two different formulas are effective for treating dysmenorrhea-tokishakuyakusan and keishibukuryogan; however, the criteria by which specialists select the appropriate formula for each patient are not clear. We compared patients treated with tokishakuyakusan and those with keishibukuryogan and proposed a predictive model. The study included 168 primary and secondary dysmenorrhea patients who visited the Kampo Clinic at Keio University Hospital. We collected clinical data from 128 dysmenorrhea patients, compared the two patient groups and selected significantly different factors as potential predictors, and used logistic regression to establish a model. An external validation was performed using 40 dysmenorrhea patients. Lightheadedness, BMI < 18.5, and a weak abdomen were significantly more frequent in the tokishakuyakusan group; tendency to sweat, heat intolerance, leg numbness, a cold sensation in the lower back, a strong abdomen, and paraumbilical tenderness and resistance were more frequent in the keishibukuryogan group. The final model fitted the data well. Internally estimated accuracy was 81.2%, and a leave-one-out cross-validation estimate of accuracy was 80.5%. External validation accuracy was 85.0%. We proposed a model for predicting the use of two Kampo formulas for dysmenorrhea, which should be validated in prospective trials.

24981981|t|A Simultaneous Determination of Principal Compounds in Tokishakuyakusan by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector.
24981981|a|We developed a simultaneous analysis method using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD) for six principal compounds (atractylenolide III, alisol A, alisol B, paeoniflorin, ferulic acid and (Z)-ligustilide) in a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, tokishakuyakusan (TSS). The HPLC separation was conducted on a reversed-phase TSK-gel ODS-80TS column (4.6 i.d.   250 mm, 5   m) at 40  C with a 0.1% phosphoric acid-acetonitrile gradient system. The DAD detection wavelength was set at 205, 232 and 330 nm. Calibration curves for the compounds showed linear regressions with correlation coefficients of >0.999. The intra- and inter-day precision (i.e., the relative standard deviation) were in the range of 0.50-1.55 and 0.70-1.80%, respectively. The average recovery yields of the compounds ranged from 98.3 to 103%. The present results will contribute to shorter analysis times with less organic solvent compared with the individual analysis of each compound for the evaluation of TSS. The application of the established method to TSS will also provide helpful information for the further pharmacological and clinical studies.

26379740|t|Keishibukuryogan, a Traditional Japanese Medicine, Inhibits Platelet Aggregation in Guinea Pig Whole Blood.
26379740|a|UNASSIGNED: Effects of keishibukuryogan (KBG) on platelet aggregation were investigated. To ensure the specificity of KBG, tokishakuyakusan (TSS) and kamisyoyosan (KSS), which are known to have platelet aggregation-inhibiting effects, and rikkunshito (RKT) and shakuyakukanzoto (SKT), which are considered to be devoid of such effects, were used for comparison. The platelet aggregation of each test drug was measured by the screen filtration pressure method using whole blood of guinea pigs and expressed as a collagen-induced pressure rate (%) or a collagen concentration required for 50% increase in the pressure rate (PATI value). KBG suppressed the collagen-induced whole blood pressure rate increase and increased the PATI value, like TSS and KSS. Neither RKT nor SKT showed these effects. The Moutan cortex and Cinnamomi cortex, the constituent crude drugs of KBG, showed KBG-like pressure rate suppression and PATI-increasing effects. Furthermore, paeonol, a representative component of Moutan cortex, and aspirin which is known to have platelet aggregation-inhibiting activity (COX-1 inhibitor) also showed similar effects. These results suggest that the platelet aggregation-inhibiting activity of the constituent crude drugs Moutan cortex and Cinnamomi cortex is involved in the improving effects of KBG on impaired microcirculation and that paeonol plays a role in these effects.

11789192|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Minor Bupleurum Decoction (MBD) and its decomposed preparations, decomposition-1 (DC-1) and decomposition-2 (DC-2) in myocardial protection and immunoregulation on coxsackie virus B3m induced myocarditis in mice. METHODS: Murine model of experimental myocarditis caused by coxsackie virus B3m was developed in Balb/c mice, and were treated by MBD, DC-1 and DC-2. Natural killer (NK) cell activity, T-lymphocyte subsets and histopathological change of myocardium were examined at various times after MBD, DC-1 and DC-2 were taken. RESULTS: (1) MBD and DC-2 could increase the NK cell activity significantly, and also regulate the T-lymphocyte subsets, while DC-1 did not have this kind of effect; (2) All MBD, DC-1 and DC-2 could protect myocardium obviously, the effect of MBD is better than those of its decomposed preparations. CONCLUSION: MBD and DC-2 had bi-directional regulation on NK cell activity and T-cell subsets, all the 3 groups could obviously protect myocardium.

26162646|t|Clinical pharmacology of daikenchuto assessed by transit analysis using radiopaque markers in patients with colon cancer undergoing open surgery: a multicenter double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study (JFMC39-0902 additional study).
26162646|a|BACKGROUND: This exploratory trial was conducted to investigate whether daikenchuto accelerates the recovery of gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing open surgery for sigmoid or rectosigmoid cancer. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients who underwent colectomy at one of the 11 clinical trial sites in Japan from January 2009 to June 2011 were registered in the study. Patients received either placebo or daikenchuto (15.0 g/day, 5 g three times a day) from postoperative day 2 to postoperative day 8. The study end points included the gastrointestinal tract transit time evaluated with radiopaque markers and the time to first flatus. The safety profile of daikenchuto was also evaluated until postoperative day 8. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (daikenchuto, n = 38; placebo, n = 33) were statistically analyzed. Although the number of radiopaque markers in the anal side of the small intestine at 6 h was significantly greater in the daikenchuto group than in the placebo group (15.19 vs 10.06, p = 0.008), the total transit analysis results and the mean time to first flatus did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Daikenchuto has a positive effect on the resolution of delayed gastric emptying, but has a limited effect on the resolution of postoperative paralytic ileus after open surgery in patients with sigmoid or rectosigmoid cancer. Daikenchuto may contribute to early oral intake in the postoperative course.

19631346|t|The effects of daikenchuto (DKT) on propulsive motility in the colon.
19631346|a|BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to examine the use of daikenchuto (DKT), a traditional Japanese medicine, as a potential treatment for opiate-induced slowing of intestinal transit in an isolated guinea pig colon model of motility. METHODS: Isolated segments of distal guinea pig colon were mounted in a perfusion chamber and imaged with a digital video camera interfaced with a computer. Fecal pellets were inserted into the oral end of the colonic segment and the rates of propulsive motility over a 3 to 4 cm segment of colon were determined in the presence and absence of test compounds. In addition, intracellular recordings were obtained from intact circular muscle, and the responsiveness of inhibitory and excitatory junction potentials to DKT was evaluated. RESULTS: The addition of D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly-ol5 (DAMGO), a selective  -receptor agonist, caused a concentration dependent decrease in colon motility. Naloxone did not affect basal activity, but partially restored motility in the DAMGO treated preparations. DKT (1   10(-4)-3   10(-4)g/mL) also reversed the inhibitory effect of DAMGO treated colon in a concentration dependent manner. At higher concentrations (1   10(-3)-3   10(-3)g/mL), however, this effect was lost. Motility slowed even further when naloxone and DKT were combined with noticeable disruptions in spatiotemporal patterns. Interestingly, when added alone, DKT resulted in reverse peristalsis of the pellet. In electrophysiologic studies DKT inhibited both excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials. CONCLUSIONS: DKT appears to be as effective as naloxone in restoring motility in DAMGO treated colon. These two agents, however, do not appear to have an additive effect. When used on untreated colon segments, DKT appears to cause disruptions in the intrinsic reflex circuit of the gut resulting in a disruption of neuromuscular communication.

25747978|t|The kampo medicine daikenchuto inhibits peritoneal fibrosis in mice.
25747978|a|Long-term peritoneal dialysis therapy causes inflammation and histological changes in the peritoneal membrane. Inflammation generally activates fibroblasts and results in fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. Heat-shock protein 47 (HSP 47), a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, is localized in myofibroblasts and is involved in the progression of peritoneal fibrosis. Daikenchuto (DKT), a Kampo medicine, is used to prevent postoperative colon adhesion. It inhibits inflammation and HSP 47 expression in the gastrointestinal tract. We examined the effect of DKT on chlorhexidine gluconate (CG)-induced peritoneal fibrosis in mice injected with 0.1% CG dissolved in 15% ethanol. DKT was dissolved in the drinking water. Histological changes were assessed using Masson trichrome staining. Cells expressing a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), HSP 47, phospho-Smad 2/3, F4/80, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were examined immunohistochemically. Compared with the control group, the peritoneal tissues of the CG group were markedly thickened, and the number of cells expressing a-SMA, HSP 47, phospho-Smad 2/3, F4/80, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was significantly increased. However, these changes were inhibited in the DKT-treated group. These results indicate that DKT can prevent peritoneal fibrosis by inhibiting inflammation and HSP 47 expression.

24129965|a|PURPOSE: Despite numerous studies, the best postoperative therapy for Crohn's disease is still undefined. We retrospectively evaluated the effects of postoperative maintenance therapy with daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, on the reoperation rate at 3  years in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: A total of 258 patients who underwent surgery for Crohn's disease were identified for the study. For the prevention of postoperative recurrence, patients were stratified to receive 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine or daikenchuto, and their effects on preventing reoperation at 3  years were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 258 patients, 44 required reoperation with intestinal resection within 3  years due to disease recurrence. The 3-year reoperation rate was significantly lower in the postoperative daikenchuto group than in the non-daikenchuto group (11.3 vs. 24.5  %, P  =  0.01), and was similarly significantly lower in the postoperative 5-aminosalicylic acid group than in the non-5-aminosalicylic acid group (14.8 vs. 29.6  %, P  =  0.0049). A multivariate Cox analysis showed that postoperative daikenchuto (P  =  0.035) and postoperative 5-aminosalicylic acid (P  =  0.022) were significantly and independently associated with the rate of reoperation at 3  years in patients with Crohn's disease. CONCLUSION: We propose that continuous daikenchuto therapy is a clinically useful and feasible maintenance therapy for the prevention of postoperative reoperation in patients with Crohn's disease.

26927243|t|Efficacy and safety of daikenchuto (TJ-100) in pregnant women with constipation.
26927243|a|OBJECTIVE: Constipation is common and a significant problem in pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and the safety of daikenchuto in pregnant women with constipation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective study, and a total of 20 patients were registered between February 2010 and August 2012. The patients received 7.5  g/d of daikenchuto for 28  days from the day of registration. All enrolled patients were asked to complete the constipation assessment scale (CAS) every day. In addition, we measured the aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels to assess the adverse effects of daikenchuto. RESULTS: The CAS scores were significantly lower at 28  days after daikenchuto treatment (p  =  0.019), with a significant effect achieved on Day 1. The impact of the therapy was greatest in the second trimester (p  =  0.043). No significant adverse effects of daikenchuto were observed, and the rates of preterm birth and pregnancy-induced hypertension were 10% and 5%, respectively, which are similar to previously reported values. CONCLUSION: We herein demonstrated the efficacy and safety of daikenchuto in pregnant women with constipation. We hope that our findings will aid in the management of constipation in pregnant women.

25089144|t|Traditional Japanese medicine daikenchuto improves functional constipation in poststroke patients.
25089144|a|Poststroke patients with functional constipation, assessed by the Rome III criteria, from 6 hospitals were recruited in a study on the effects of the traditional Japanese medicine Daikenchuto (DKT) on constipation. Thirty-four patients (17 men and 17 women; mean age: 78.1    11.6 years) were randomly assigned to 2 groups; all patients received conventional therapy for constipation, and patients in the DKT group received 15   g/day of DKT for 4 weeks. Constipation scoring system (CSS) points and the gas volume score (GVS) (the measure of the intestinal gas volume calculated from plain abdominal radiographs) were recorded before and after a 4-week observation period. The total score on the CSS improved significantly in the DKT group compared to the control (P < 0.01). In addition, scores for some CSS subcategories (frequency of bowel movements, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and need for enema/disimpaction) significantly improved in the DKT group (P < 0.01, P = 0.049, and P = 0.03, resp.). The GVS was also significantly reduced in the DKT group compared to the control (P = 0.03). DKT in addition to conventional therapy is effective in treating functional constipation in poststroke patients. This study was a randomized controlled trial and was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (no. UMIN000007393).

20378829|t|Effect of daikenchuto (TU-100) on gastrointestinal and colonic transit in humans.
20378829|a|Daikenchuto (TU-100) is a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine used to treat postoperative ileus. TU-100 dose dependently increases gastrointestinal (GI) motility by modulating cholinergic and serotonergic mechanisms in animal studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of orally administered TU-100 on GI and colonic transit and bowel function in healthy humans. In a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study, 60 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or TU-100 2.5 g or 5 g tid ingested immediately before meals for 5 consecutive days. We measured GI and colonic transit by validated scintigraphy and stool frequency and consistency by daily diaries of bowel function. There were overall treatment effects on colonic filling at 6 h without any significant differences between each dose of TU-100 and placebo. There tended to be overall treatment effects on ascending colon (AC) emptying half-time; the TU-100 (7.5 g/day) treatment significantly accelerated AC emptying compared with placebo. There were numerically higher values of GC24 (which reflect overall colonic transit) with both doses of TU-100, but these changes were not statistically significant. There were no significant overall treatment effects on gastric emptying or stool frequency and consistency. One subject, who received 7.5 g/day of TU-100, had elevated creatine phosphokinase following the study. TU-100 (7.5 g/day) significantly accelerated AC emptying. Further randomized controlled trials in patients with functional constipation or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation are warranted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of TU-100 in these disorders.

26300774|t|Complementary and synergistic therapeutic effects of compounds found in Kampo medicine: analysis of daikenchuto.
26300774|a|Herbal medicines have been used in Japan for more than 1500 years and traditional Japanese medicines (Kampo medicines) are now fully integrated into the modern healthcare system. In total, 148 Kampo formulae are officially approved as prescription drugs and covered by the national health insurance system in Japan. However, despite their long track record of clinical use, the multi-targeted, multi-component properties of Kampo medicines, which are fundamentally different from Western medicines, have made it difficult to create a suitable framework for conducting well-designed, large-scale clinical trials. In turn, this has led to misconceptions among western trained physicians concerning the paucity of scientific evidence for the beneficial effects of Kampo medicines. Fortunately, there has been a recent surge in scientifically robust data from basic and clinical studies for some of the Kampo medicines, e.g., daikenchuto (TU-100). Numerous basic and clinical studies on TU-100, including placebo-controlled double-blind studies for various gastrointestinal disorders, and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies, have been conducted or are in the process of being conducted in both Japan and the USA. Clinical studies suggest that TU-100 is beneficial for postoperative complications, especially ileus and abdominal bloating. ADME and basic studies indicate that the effect of TU-100 is a composite of numerous actions mediated by multiple compounds supplied via multiple routes. In addition to known mechanisms of action via enteric/sensory nerve stimulation, novel mechanisms via the TRPA1 channel and two pore domain potassium channels have recently been elucidated. TU-100 compounds target these channels with and without absorption, both before and after metabolic activation by enteric flora, with different timings and possibly with synergism.

23545807|t|Population pharmacokinetic analysis of daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese medicine (Kampo) in Japanese and US health volunteers.
23545807|a|We constructed population pharmacokinetic (PK) models for the five constituents of daikenchuto (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine. Data were collected from two randomized PK studies conducted in Japan and the United States. Participants received single oral doses of 2.5 g, 5 g, and 10 g of DKT. The plasma concentrations of five DKT constituents--hydroxy-a-sanshool (HAS), hydroxyl-b-sanshool (HBS), 6-shogaol (6S), 10-shogaol (10S), and ginsenoside Rb1 (GRB1)--were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1859 samples from 55 participants (US, n = 36; Japanese, n = 19) were included in the analysis. Population PK models of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S were best described by a one or two-compartment model with a bolus input. On the other hand, the model of GRB1 was best described by a one-compartment model with nonlinear extravascular input. Among the covariates evaluated, body mass index (BMI) and age were found to influence oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (Vd/F) for HAS and HBS, respectively. The influence of body weight on CL/F and Vd/F for 6S was demonstrated. Marked differences were observed in mean plasma concentrations of HAS and HBS between Japanese and US participants. However, the simulation results indicated that the difference in plasma concentrations may be attributed to the difference in demographic factors such as BMI, body weight, and age, whereas ethnic difference between the Japanese and US participants was considered minimal.

21122500|t|Anti-colitis and -adhesion effects of daikenchuto via endogenous adrenomedullin enhancement in Crohn's disease mouse model.
21122500|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a member of the calcitonin family of regulatory peptides, and is reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the therapeutic effects of daikenchuto (DKT), an extracted Japanese herbal medicine, on the regulation of endogenous ADM in the gastrointestinal tract in a CD mouse model. METHODS: Colitis was induced in mice by intrarectal instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS); afterwards, DKT was given orally. Colonic damage was assessed on day 3 by macroscopic and microscopic observation, enzyme immunoassays of proinflammatory cytokines in the colonic mucosa, and serum amyloid A (SAA), a hepatic acute-phase protein. To determine the involvement of ADM, an ADM antagonist was instilled intrarectally before DKT administration. The effect of DKT on ADM production by intestinal epithelial cells was evaluated by enzyme immunoassay and real-time PCR. RESULTS: DKT significantly attenuated mucosal damage and colonic inflammatory adhesions, and inhibited elevations of SAA in plasma and the proinflammatory cytokines TNFa and IFNy in the colon. Small and large intestinal epithelial cells produced higher levels of ADM after DKT stimulation. A DKT-treated IEC-6 cell line also showed enhanced ADM production at protein and mRNA levels. Abolition of this effect by pretreatment with an ADM antagonist shows that DKT appears to exert its anti-colitis effect via up-regulation of endogenous ADM in the intestinal tract. CONCLUSION: DKT exerts beneficial effects in a CD mouse model through endogenous release and production of ADM. Endogenous ADM may be a therapeutic target for CD.

20689019|t|Profiling of the compounds absorbed in human plasma and urine after oral administration of a traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine, daikenchuto.
20689019|a|Daikenchuto (DKT), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders including postoperative ileus and has been integrated into the modern medical care system in Japan as a prescription drug. DKT is a multiherbal medicine consisting of Japanese pepper (zanthoxylum fruit), processed ginger, and ginseng with maltose as an additive. Despite substantial research on the pharmacological activities of DKT and its ingredients, the lack of studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of DKT has made it difficult to obtain a consistent picture of its mechanism of action. In the present study, we constructed an analysis procedure consisting of seven conditions of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis, which enabled the identification of 44 ingredients of DKT component herbs. We investigated the plasma and urine profiles of these ingredients 0.5 to 8 h after oral administration of 15.0 g of DKT in four healthy volunteers. The results indicated that 1) hydroxy-a-sanshool and [6]-shogaol, the prominent peaks in plasma derived from Japanese pepper and ginger, respectively, were detected at 0.5 h and thereafter decreased throughout the sampling period; 2) ginsenoside Rb(1), a prominent peak derived from ginseng, increased gradually during the sampling period; 3) glucuronide conjugates of hydroxy-sanshools, shogaols, and gingerols were detected in plasma and urine; and 4) no obvious differences between samples from the two male and the two female individuals were observed. These results provide a strong basis for future studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of DKT.

21309420|t|The herbal medicine daikenchuto ameliorates an impaired anorectal motor activity in postoperative pediatric patients with an anorectal malformation--a pilot study.
21309420|a|Fecoflowmetry (FFM) has been introduced to simulate natural anorectal evacuation. So far, few reports have described the effect of the herbal medicine Daikenchuto (DKT) on impaired anorectal motor function. The aim of this pilot study was to assess anorectal motor function by FFM in postoperatively impaired patients with an anorectal malformation (ARM) before and after administration of DKT. Six postoperative patients with ARM (mean age, 7.8 years) who complained of intractable constipation with soiling in spite of administration of magnesia as a laxative were assessed over an extended period. These patients received 0.3 g/kg/d of DKT for an average of 128 days. Evacuative rate and maximum fecal stream flow were seen to increase significantly after administration of DKT when compared with values before administration of DKT. In conclusion, DKT had a favorable clinical effect on anorectal motor function in postoperative patients with ARM.

21724872|t|Pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto, a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo) after single oral administration to healthy Japanese volunteers.
21724872|a|The pharmacokinetics of daikenchuto (TJ-100), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese medicine, were investigated in healthy Japanese volunteers after a single oral administration of 2.5-, 5-, and 10-g doses. Six ingredients [hydroxy-a-sanshool (HAS), hydroxy-b-sanshool (HBS), [6]-shogaol (6S), [10]-shogaol (10S), ginsenoside Rb   (GRB1), and ginsenoside Rg   (GRG1)] of TJ-100 were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that HAS, an ingredient derived from Zanthoxylum piperitum fruit, exhibited the highest plasma concentration among the six ingredients investigated. The plasma concentrations of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S reached the maximum concentration (approximately 400, 80, 0.14, and 0.6 ng/ml, respectively, after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) within 30 min after administration, and the mean half-life was approximately 2 h. Thus, these compounds were rapidly absorbed and eliminated. The plasma concentration of GRB1 reached the maximum concentration (2 ng/ml after a 5-g administration of TJ-100) at approximately 4 h after administration and the half-life of GRB1 was approximately 40 h. The plasma concentration of GRG1 was extremely low (<0.023 ng/ml). The pharmacokinetics of HAS, HBS, 6S, and 10S, were linear within the range of 2.5 to 10 g/day of TJ-100. On the other hand, the kinetics of GRB1 and GRG1 were not proportional to dosage, and plateauing was observed.

26516578|t|Intestinal, portal, and peripheral profiles of daikenchuto (TU-100)'s active ingredients after oral administration.
26516578|a|A pharmaceutical grade Japanese traditional medicine, daikenchuto (TU-100), consisting of Japanese pepper, processed ginger, and ginseng, has been widely used for various intestinal disorders in Japan and now under development as a new therapeutic drug in the US. It is suggested that TU-100 ingredients exert pharmacological effects on intestines via two routes, from the luminal side before absorption and the peripheral blood stream after absorption. Therefore, in order to fully understand the pharmacological actions of TU-100, it is critically important to know the intraluminal amounts and forms of ingested TU-100 ingredients. In the present study, after administrating TU-100 to rats, the concentrations of TU-100 ingredients and their conjugates in the peripheral and portal blood and ileal contents were determined by LC-MS/MS. Next, TU-100 was administered to patients with ileostomy bags, but whose small intestines are diagnosed as healthy, and the ingredients/conjugates in the ileal effluent were analyzed. The results suggest that: (1) Pepper ingredients hydroxysanshools are rapidly absorbed and enter systemic circulation, (2) Ginseng ingredients ginsenosides are transported to the colon with the least absorption, (3) Ginger ingredients gingerols are absorbed and some conjugated in the small intestine and transported via the portal vein. While only a small amount of gingerols/gingerol conjugates enter systemic circulation, considerable amounts reappear in the small intestine. Thus, the effect of TU-100 on the intestines is believed to be a composite of multiple actions by multiple compounds supplied via multiple routes.

23451764|t|Randomised clinical trial: the effects of daikenchuto, TU-100, on gastrointestinal and colonic transit, anorectal and bowel function in female patients with functional constipation.
23451764|a|BACKGROUND: Daikenchuto, a Japanese herbal medicine used for post-operative ileus and constipation, dose dependently stimulates gastrointestinal (GI) motility and decreases rectal compliance and sensation. Effects of TU-100 (commercial form of daikenchuto) in adults with constipation are unknown. AIM: To compare the effects of oral TU-100, 2.5 g t.d.s. or 5 g t.d.s. and placebo t.d.s. on GI and colonic transit (CT), rectal compliance (RC) and sensation thresholds (RST), anal sphincter pressures (ASP) and bowel function in female patients with functional constipation (FC). METHODS: We conducted a single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, pharmacodynamic study; 45 female patients with FC without evidence of rectal evacuation disorder were assigned to 28 days' treatment with oral placebo or TU-100 (Tsumura USA, Princeton, NJ, USA). Demographic data and CT were measured at baseline and randomisation stratified by baseline CT (GC> or <1.9) and by BMI (<25 or >= 25 kg/m(2) ). At the end of treatment period, we measured GI and CT by scintigraphy, RST and RC by barostat, ASP by manometry, psychosensory sensations, bowel function by daily diary and quality of life (QOL). The study had power to detect effect sizes of 33% (CT), 40% (RC) and 46% (RST). Statistical analysis included BMI as covariate. RESULTS: TU-100 had no significant effects on GI or CT, RC, ASP, recto-anal pressure difference, or RST. The 5 g t.d.s./day dose was associated with lower RST for first sensation and gas (unadjusted P: 0.045 and 0.024 respectively). There were no treatment effects on psychosensory symptoms, stool frequency, stool consistency or QOL. CONCLUSION: Mechanisms underlying the observed clinical benefit of TU-100 remain unclear (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01139216).

21186335|t|Possible involvement of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channel in postoperative adhesive obstruction and its prevention by a kampo (traditional Japanese) medicine, daikenchuto.
21186335|a|This study focused on the localization of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) in the intestines in postoperative adhesion model rats and investigated the underlying mechanism for the anti-adhesion action of daikenchuto (DKT), especially in relation to TRPV1. Postoperative intestinal adhesion was induced by sprinkling talc in the small intestine. The expression of TRPV1 mRNA was examined by in situ hybridization and real-time RT-PCR. The effects of DKT and its major ingredient, hydroxy sanshool, with or without ruthenium red, a TRP-channel antagonist, on talc-induced intestinal adhesions were evaluated. The level of TRPV1 mRNA was higher in the adhesion regions of talc-treated rats than in normal small intestine of sham-operated rats. Localization of TRPV1 mRNA expression was identified in the submucosal plexus of both sham-operated and talc-treated rats; and in talc-treated rats, it was observed also in the myenteric plexus and regions of adhesion. Capsaicin, DKT, and hydroxy sanshool significantly prevented formation of intestinal adhesions. The effects of DKT and hydroxy sanshool were abrogated by subcutaneous injection of ruthenium red. These results suggest that pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 might be a possible therapeutic option in postoperative intestinal adhesion, which might be relevant to the prevention of postoperative adhesive obstruction by DKT.

26747224|t|Evaluation of the efficacy of daikenchuto (TJ -100) for the prevention of paralytic ileus after pancreaticoduodenectomy: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
26747224|a|BACKGROUND: We assessed the efficacy of TJ-100 taken perioperatively to recovery among patients with periampullary tumor or tumor of the head of the pancreas who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial (JAPAN-PD Study), patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive TJ-100 or placebo. The coprimary endpoints were (1) incidence of postoperative paralytic ileus lasting >72  hours after surgery and (2) time to occurrence of postoperative paralytic ileus. This trial is registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (000007975) and at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01607307). RESULTS: From August 2012 through July 2013, we assessed 273 patients for eligibility, and 224 underwent randomization; 112 patients received TJ-100, and 112 patients received placebo. The population for analysis consisted of 104 patients who received TJ-100 and 103 who received placebo. Paralytic ileus occurred 35 (33.7%) in the TJ-100 group and 38 (36.9%) in the placebo group (P  =  .626). Time to first flatus was 2.25 (2.00-2.50) days in the TJ-100 group and 2.50 (1.50-2.50) days in the placebo group (P  =  .343). Among 23 patients who underwent a pylorus ring-preserving PD, time to first flatus was lower in the TJ-100 group than in the placebo group: 0.50 (0.50-1.00) days versus 1.50 (0.50-3.00) days (P  =  .034). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that use of TJ-100 did not improve recovery from paralytic ileus after PD, and may preclude the routine use of TJ-100 in clinical practice after PD operation.

26707752|t|Traditional Japanese medicines inhibit compound action potentials in the frog sciatic nerve.
26707752|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicines have a variety of clinical effects including pain alleviation, but evidence for a mechanism for their pain relief has not yet been elucidated fully. Considering that Kampo medicine contains many plant-derived chemicals having an ability to inhibit nerve action potential conduction, it is possible that this medicine inhibits nerve conduction. The purpose of the present study was to know how various Kampo medicines affect nerve conduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of Kampo and crude medicines on compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the frog sciatic nerve by using the air-gap method. RESULTS: Daikenchuto, rikkosan, kikyoto, rikkunshito, shakuyakukanzoto and kakkonto concentration-dependently reduced the peak amplitude of the CAP. Among the Kampo medicines, daikenchuto was the most effective in inhibiting CAPs. Daikenchuto is composed of three kinds of crude medicine, Japanese pepper, processed ginger and ginseng radix. When the crude medicines were tested, Japanese pepper and processed ginger reduced CAP peak amplitudes, while ginseng radix hardly affected CAPs. Moreover, there was an interaction between the Japanese pepper and processed ginger activities in such that one medicine at low but not high concentrations increased the extent of the inhibition by the other one that was co-applied. CONCLUSIONS: Kampo medicines have an ability to inhibit nerve conduction. This action of daikenchuto is due to Japanese pepper and processed ginger but not ginseng radix, probably through an interaction between Japanese pepper and processed ginger in a manner dependent on their concentrations. Nerve conduction inhibition could contribute to at least a part of Kampo medicine's clinical effects such as pain alleviation.

24348533|t|Preventive Effect of TU-100 on a Type-2 Model of Colitis in Mice: Possible Involvement of Enhancing Adrenomedullin in Intestinal Epithelial Cells.
24348533|a|Purpose. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), have histopathologically and immunologically different characteristics. We previously reported that a traditional Japanese medicine, daikenchuto (TU-100), ameliorated a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid- (TNBS-) induced type-1 model colitis exhibiting histopathological features of CD through adrenomedullin (ADM) enhancement. Our current aims were to examine whether TU-100 ameliorates a type-2 model colitis that histologically resembles UC and identify the active ingredients. Methods. TU-100 was administered orally to mice with oxazolone- (OXN-) induced type-2 model colitis. The morbidity was evaluated by body weight loss and the macroscopic score of colonic lesions. ADM was quantified using an EIA kit. Results. TU-100 prevented weight loss and colon ulceration. ADM production by intestinal epithelial cells was increased by TU-100 addition. Screening to identify active ingredients showed that [6]-shogaol and hydroxy a -sanshool enhanced ADM production. Conclusions. TU-100 exerted a protective effect in OXN-induced type-2 model colitis, indicating that TU-100 may be a beneficial agent for treatment of UC.

25564322|t|Effects of Daikenchuto, a Japanese Herb, on Intestinal Motility After Total Gastrectomy: a Prospective Randomized Trial.
25564322|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of daikenchuto (DKT), a commonly prescribed, traditional Japanese herbal medicine, on postoperative intestinal dysfunction after gastric cancer surgery. METHODS: Patients with gastric cancer scheduled for a total gastrectomy were randomly assigned before surgery to receive either no treatment (n   =   40; control group) or DKT (7.5  g/day, t.i.d.) for 3  months (n   =   41) postoperatively. We examined gastrointestinal motility, stool attributes, the quantity of bowel gas, the quality of life, and the incidence of postoperative ileus. RESULTS: During the hospital stay, significant differences were observed between the DKT group and controls in the number of stools per day (1.1        0.6 vs 0.8        0.4, respectively; P   =   0.037) and stool consistencies (Bristol scale ratings were 3.7        0.8 vs 3.1        0.8, respectively; P   =   0.041). The DKT group showed significant reductions in gas volume scores, calculated from abdominal radiographs, at 7  days, 1  month, and 3  months after surgery. The groups did not show significant differences in quality of life scores (based on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) or in the incidence of postoperative ileus. CONCLUSION: DKT improved bowel movements, stool properties, and bowel gas. These results suggested that DKT promoted early postoperative bowel functions after total gastrectomy.

25837933|t|Contraction of gut smooth muscle cells assessed by fluorescence imaging.
25837933|a|Here we discuss the development of a novel cell imaging system for the evaluation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction. SMCs were isolated from the circular and longitudinal muscular layers of mouse small intestine by enzymatic digestion. SMCs were stimulated by test agents, thereafter fixed in acrolein. Actin in fixed SMCs was stained with phalloidin and cell length was determined by measuring diameter at the large end of phalloidin-stained strings within the cells. The contractile response was taken as the decrease in the average length of a population of stimulated-SMCs. Various mediators and chemically identified compounds of daikenchuto (DKT), pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese prokinetics, were examined. Verification of the integrity of SMC morphology by phalloidin and DAPI staining and semi-automatic measurement of cell length using an imaging analyzer was a reliable method by which to quantify the contractile response. Serotonin, substance P, prostaglandin E2 and histamine induced SMC contraction in concentration-dependent manner. Two components of DKT, hydroxy-a-sanshool and hydroxy-b-sanshool, induced contraction of SMCs. We established a novel cell imaging technique to evaluate SMC contractility. This method may facilitate investigation into SMC activity and its role in gastrointestinal motility, and may assist in the discovery of new prokinetic agents.

24595550|t|Effect of TU-100, a traditional Japanese medicine, administered after hepatic resection in patients with liver cancer: a multi-center, phase III trial (JFMC40-1001).
24595550|a|BACKGROUND: This multi-center, phase III trial assesses the efficacy of daikenchuto (TU-100) on gastrointestinal disorders after hepatic resection (UMIN Registration No. 000003103). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 231 patients, who underwent hepatic resection at 26 Japanese centers, were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral doses (15  g/day, three times a day) of TU-100 or placebo control from preoperative day 3 to postoperative day 10, except on the day of surgery. Primary end points were the time from extubation until the first postoperative bowel movement (FBM-T), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ammonia levels. RESULTS: Finally, 209 patients (TU-100: n  =  108, placebo: n  =  101) were included in the statistical analysis. The median FBM-T was 88.2  h (95  % CI 74.0-94.1) in the TU-100 group and 93.1  h (95  % CI 83.3-99.4) in the placebo group, demonstrating that TU-100 accelerated the time to first bowel movement significantly more than placebo control. Serum CRP levels did not differ significantly during the study period, although serum CRP levels in the TU-100 group tended to be lower than those in the placebo group in patients with grade B liver damage. Meanwhile, the two groups had similar serum ammonia levels. TU-100-related serious adverse events did not occur during the study. CONCLUSIONS: TU-100 appears to improve gastrointestinal dysmotility and reduce serum CRP levels in patients with grade B liver damage after hepatectomy. TU-100 is an effective treatment option after hepatic resection in patients with liver cancer.

24895799|t|Daikenchuto stimulates colonic motility after laparoscopic-assisted colectomy.
24895799|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Paralytic ileus after laparoscopic-assisted surgery often occurs. We investigated whether daikenchuto (DKT), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, improves intestinal motility in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for colon cancer. METHODOLOGY: Fifty-four patients who underwent colectomy at Iwate Medical University Hospital between October 2010 and March 2012 were randomized to either the DKT group (7.5 g/day, p.o.) or the control group (lactobacillus preparation, 3g/day, p.o.). Primary endpoints included time to first flatus, bowel movement, and tolerance of diet after extubation. Secondary endpoints were WBC count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, length of hospital stay, and postoperative ileus. Colonic transit time was measured using radiopaque markers and abdominal radiographs. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (DKT, 26 vs. control, 25) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The DKT group had significantly faster time until first flatus (67.5 +/- 13.6h vs. 77.9 +/- 11.8h, P < 0.01) and bowel movement (82.9 +/- 17.8h vs. 99.5 +/- 18.9h, P < 0.01) and colonic transit time (91.9 +/- 19.8h vs. 115.2 +/- 12.8 h, P < 0.05). There were no significant intergroup differences in secondary endpoints and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: DKT accelerates colonic motility in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for colon cancer.

24857966|t|TU-100 (Daikenchuto) and ginger ameliorate anti-CD3 antibody induced T cell-mediated murine enteritis: microbe-independent effects involving Akt and NF-kB suppression.
24857966|a|The Japanese traditional medicine daikenchuto (TU-100) has anti-inflammatory activities, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. TU-100 includes ginger, ginseng, and Japanese pepper, each component possessing bioactive properties. The effects of TU-100 and individual components were investigated in a model of intestinal T lymphocyte activation using anti-CD3 antibody. To determine contribution of intestinal bacteria, specific pathogen free (SPF) and germ free (GF) mice were used. TU-100 or its components were delivered by diet or by gavage. Anti-CD3 antibody increased jejunal accumulation of fluid, increased TNFa, and induced intestinal epithelial apoptosis in both SPF and GF mice, which was blocked by either TU-100 or ginger, but not by ginseng or Japanese pepper. TU-100 and ginger also blocked anti-CD3-stimulated Akt and NF-kB activation. A co-culture system of colonic Caco2BBE and Jurkat-1 cells was used to examine T-lymphocyte/epithelial cells interactions. Jurkat-1 cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 to produce TNFa that activates epithelial cell NF-kB. TU-100 and ginger blocked anti-CD3 antibody activation of Akt in Jurkat cells, decreasing their TNFa production. Additionally, TU-100 and ginger alone blocked direct TNFa stimulation of Caco2BBE cells and decreased activation of caspase-3 and polyADP ribose. The present studies demonstrate a new anti-inflammatory action of TU-100 that is microbe-independent and due to its ginger component.

23275609|t|Epithelial transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1)-dependent adrenomedullin upregulates blood flow in rat small intestine.
23275609|a|The functional roles of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the gastrointestinal tract have garnered considerable attention in recent years. We previously reported that daikenchuto (TU-100), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, increased intestinal blood flow (IBF) via adrenomedullin (ADM) release from intestinal epithelial (IE) cells (Kono T et al. J Crohns Colitis 4: 161-170, 2010). TU-100 contains multiple TRP activators. In the present study, therefore, we examined the involvement of TRP channels in the ADM-mediated vasodilatatory effect of TU-100. Rats were treated intraduodenally with the TRP vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) agonist capsaicin (CAP), the TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) agonist allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), or TU-100, and jejunum IBF was evaluated using laser-Doppler blood flowmetry. All three compounds resulted in vasodilatation, and the vasodilatory effect of TU-100 was abolished by a TRPA1 antagonist but not by a TRPV1 antagonist. Vasodilatation induced by AITC and TU-100 was abrogated by anti-ADM antibody treatment. RT-PCR and flow cytometry revealed that an IEC-6 cell line originated from the small intestine and purified IE cells expressed ADM and TRPA1 but not TRPV1. AITC increased ADM release in IEC cells remarkably, while CAP had no effect. TU-100 and its ingredient 6-shogaol (6SG) increased ADM release dose-dependently, and the effects were abrogated by a TRPA1 antagonist. 6SG showed similar TRPA1-dependent vasodilatation in vivo. These results indicate that TRPA1 in IE cells may play an important role in controlling bowel microcirculation via ADM release. Epithelial TRPA1 appears to be a promising target for the development of novel strategies for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders.

21266812|t|Daikenchuto ameliorates muscle hypercontractility in a murine T-cell-mediated persistent gut motor dysfunction model.
21266812|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Low-grade inflammation and immunological alterations are evident in functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We evaluated the effects of daikenchuto (DKT), a pharmaceutical grade Japanese herbal medicine, on the hypercontractility of intestinal smooth muscle persisting after acute inflammation induced by a T-cell-activating anti-CD3 antibody (aCD3). METHODS: BALB/c mice were injected with aCD3 (12.5  g, i.p.), and DKT (2.7 g/kg) was administered orally once daily for 1 week. The contraction of isolated small intestinal muscle strips and muscle cells was examined on day 7 after aCD3 injection. The gene and protein expressions in the small intestines were evaluated by real-time PCR and multiplex immunoassays, respectively, on days 1, 3 and 7 after aCD3 injection. RESULTS: aCD3 injection resulted in significant increases in carbachol-evoked contractility in the muscle strips and isolated smooth muscle cells on day 7. DKT ameliorated the aCD3-induced muscle hypercontractility on day 7 in both the muscle strips and smooth muscle cells. aCD3 injection rapidly up- and downregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Although the influence of DKT on the mRNA expressions was moderate, the protein expressions of IL-13 and IL-17 were significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We observed changes in the intestinal muscle contractility in muscle strips and muscle cells following resolution of inflammation in a T-cell-mediated model of enteropathy. The observed modulation of cytokine expression and function by DKT may lead to the development of new pharmacotherapeutic strategies aimed at a wide variety of gut motor dysfunction disorders.

27284001|t|Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 agonists improve intestinal transit in a murine model of postoperative ileus.
27284001|a|BACKGROUND: Stimulation of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), which abundantly expressed in enterochromaffin cells (ECC), has been reported to exert apparently contradictory results in in vitro contractility and in vivo gastrointestinal (GI) transit evaluations. The pharmaceutical-grade Japanese traditional medicine daikenchuto (TU-100) has been reported to be beneficial for postoperative ileus (POI) and accelerate GI transit in animals and humans. TU-100 was recently shown to increase intestinal blood flow via stimulation of TRPA1 in the epithelial cells of the small intestine (SI). METHODS: The effects of various TRPA1 agonists on motility were examined in a manipulation-induced murine POI model, in vitro culture of SI segments and an ECC model cell line, RIN-14B. KEY RESULTS: Orally administered TRPA1 agonists, aryl isothiocyanate (AITC) and cinnamaldehyde (CA), TU-100 ingredients, [6]-shogaol (6S) and y-sanshool (GS), improved SI transit in a POI model. The effects of AITC, 6S and GS but not CA were abrogated in TRPA1-deficient mice. SI segments show periodic peristaltic motor activity whose periodicity disappeared in TRPA1-deficient mice. TU-100 augmented the motility. AITC, CA and 6S increased 5-HT release from isolated SI segments and the effects of all these compounds except for CA were lost in TRPA1-deficient mice. 6S and GS induced a release of 5-HT from RIN-14B cells in a dose- and TRPA1-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: Intraluminal TRPA1 stimulation is a potential therapeutic strategy for GI motility disorders. Further investigation is required to determine whether 5-HT and/or ECC are involved in the effect of TRPA1 on motility.

25634809|t|Hydroxy-a sanshool induces colonic motor activity in rat proximal colon: a possible involvement of KCNK9.
25634809|a|UNASSIGNED: Various colonic motor activities are thought to mediate propulsion and mixing/absorption of colonic content. The Japanese traditional medicine daikenchuto (TU-100), which is widely used for postoperative ileus in Japan, accelerates colonic emptying in healthy humans. Hydroxy-a sanshool (HAS), a readily absorbable active ingredient of TU-100 and a KCNK3/KCNK9/KCNK18 blocker as well as TRPV1/TRPA1 agonist, has been investigated for its effects on colonic motility. Motility was evaluated by intraluminal pressure and video imaging of rat proximal colons in an organ bath. Distribution of KCNKs was investigated by RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Current and membrane potential were evaluated with use of recombinant KCNK3- or KCNK9-expressing Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Defecation frequency in rats was measured. HAS dose dependently induced strong propulsive "squeezing" motility, presumably as long-distance contraction (LDC). TRPV1/TRPA1 agonists induced different motility patterns. The effect of HAS was unaltered by TRPV1/TRPA1 antagonists and desensitization. Lidocaine (a nonselective KCNK blocker) and hydroxy-b sanshool (a geometrical isomer of HAS and KCNK3 blocker) also induced colonic motility as a rhythmic propagating ripple (RPR) and a LDC-like motion, respectively. HAS-induced "LDC," but not lidocaine-induced "RPR," was abrogated by a neuroleptic agent tetrodotoxin. KCNK3 and KCNK9 were located mainly in longitudinal smooth muscle cells and in neural cells in the myenteric plexus, respectively. Administration of HAS or TU-100 increased defecation frequency in normal and laparotomy rats. HAS may evoke strong LDC possibly via blockage of the neural KCNK9 channel in the colonic myenteric plexus.

27730672|t|Daikenchuto (TU-100) Suppresses Tumor Development in the Azoxymethane and APC(min/+) Mouse Models of Experimental Colon Cancer.
27730672|a|UNASSIGNED: Chemopreventative properties of traditional medicines and underlying mechanisms of action are incompletely investigated. This study demonstrates that dietary daikenchuto (TU-100), comprised of ginger, ginseng, and Japanese pepper effectively suppresses intestinal tumor development and progression in the azoxymethane (AOM) and APC(min/+) mouse models. For the AOM model, TU-100 was provided after the first of six biweekly AOM injections. Mice were sacrificed at 30   weeks. APC(min/+) mice were fed diet without or with TU-100 starting at 6   weeks, and sacrificed at 24   weeks. In both models, dietary TU-100 decreased tumor size. In APC (min/+) mice, the number of small intestinal tumors was significantly decreased. In the AOM model, both TU-100 and Japanese ginseng decreased colon tumor numbers. Decreased Ki-67 and b-catenin immunostaining and activation of numerous transduction pathways involved in tumor initiation and progression were observed. EGF receptor expression and stimulation/phosphorylation in vitro were investigated in C2BBe1 cells. TU-100, ginger, and 6-gingerol suppressed EGF receptor induced Akt activation. TU-100 and ginseng and to a lesser extent ginger or 6-gingerol inhibited EGF ERK1/2 activation. TU-100 and some of its components and metabolites of these components inhibit tumor progression in two mouse models of colon cancer by blocking downstream pathways of EGF receptor activation.

23304226|t|Chinese herbal medicine liu jun zi tang and xiang sha liu jun zi tang for functional dyspepsia: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
23304226|a|Objectives. To assess the efficacy and safety of Liu Jun Zi Tang (LJZT) and Xiang Sha Liu Jun Zi Tang (XSLJZT) for treating functional dyspepsia. Methods. Literature searches were carried out on Medline database, Cochrane Library, CNKI database, Chinese Biomedical Literature database, Wanfang database, and VIP database up to July 2012. Hand search for further references was conducted. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were performed according to the Cochrane standards. Results. Fifteen publications in total were suitable for inclusion. There was evidence that LJZT compared with prokinetic drugs increased symptom improvement (odds ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.36). There was also evidence that XSLJZT compared with prokinetic drugs increased symptom improvement (odds ratio 2.63, 95% CI 1.72 to 4.03). No adverse events were reported in LJZT or XSLJZT group in any of these randomized controlled trials. Conclusion. LJZT and XSLJZT might be more effective compared with prokinetic drugs in the treatment of functional dyspepsia, and no side effects are identified in the included trials. However, due to poor methodological quality in the majority of included studies, the potential benefit from LJZT and XSLJZT need to be confirmed in rigorously designed, multicentre, and large-scale trials.

25780683|a|The purpose of this study was to report the effect of a combination of Sa-am five-element acupuncture and eight-principle pharmacopuncture (EPP) for the treatment of an essential tremor (ET). This study reviewed the medical records treated at OO Korean medical hospital for ET by using diverse types of acupuncture without herbal medicine, other types of physical therapy, and western medication related ET or Parkinson's disease and was performed after the approval of the institutional review board (IRB). The three cases that were finally selected were then extracted and reviewed. The three cases that were finally selected involved three women in their 70s to 80s. The evaluation of the progress was made by using the numeric rating scale. A combined treatment, the method of liver excess (), from amongSa-am five-element acupuncture, and Hwangyeonhaedoktang ePP at CV23 and CV17, was applied to all cases. In all three cases, the ET was improved, and recurred ETs improved with the same treatment. The results suggest that the combined treatment of Sa-am five-element acupuncture and Hwangyeonhaedoktang ePP may be effective for treating an ET, even though this conclusion is based on only three cases.

15655286|t|Induction of apoptosis by Korean medicine Gagam-whanglyun-haedoktang through activation of caspase-3 in human leukemia cell line, HL-60 cells.
15655286|a|Gagam-whanglyun-haedoktang (GWH) is a newly designed herbal drug formula based on the traditional oriental pharmacological knowledge for the purpose of treating tumorous diseases. Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved suicide program residing in cells. In the present study, apoptosis inducing activities of the decocted water extract of GWH were studied. Results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that GWH had a strong cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells. The number of live cells was less than 20% after exposure to 1 mg/ml GWH for 48 h. GWH increased cytotoxicity of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The percentage of apoptotic cells by flow cytometric analysis of the DNA-stained cells increased to 28%, 31%, and 37% at 24 h and to 37%, 44%, and 81% at 48 h after treatment with 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/ml GWH, respectively. DNA fragmentation also occurred in apoptosis and was characterized by a ladder pattern on agarose gel. In addition, GWH increased the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. GWH-induced apoptosis was accompanied by activation of caspase-3. These results suggest that GWH induces activation of caspase-3 and eventually leads to apoptosis.

25049906|t|Effects of sheng hua tang on uterine involution and ovarian activity in postpartum dairy cows.
25049906|a|The effects of Sheng Hua Tang (SHT) on uterine involution and ovarian activity were investigated in postpartum dairy cows. SHT (70 g) was given to dairy cows (n = 10) to evaluate its effects for five days from the first postpartum day. Postpartum cows fed with a basal diet without SHT were used as the control group (n = 10). Ultrasounds and blood tests were recorded for four weeks from postpartum day seven with a 3-d interval. The results showed that the areas and diameters of endometria were significantly (p<0.01) reduced in the group that received SHT compared to the control group on the seventh postpartum day. The group that received SHT had an intrauterine fluid volume mean of 1.2  0.6 cm(3), which was significantly lower than that of the control group, 2.3  0.8 cm(3) (p<0.01) on the 13th postpartum day. In addition, the uterine tension score was a mean of 1.0  0.0 in the group that received SHT, which was also significantly lower than that of the control group, 1.5  0.5 (p<0.01) on the 19th postpartum day. Taken together, the Chinese herbal medicine remedy, SHT, promoted uterine involution and ovarian activity in postpartum dairy cows.

23118790|t|Protective effects of the traditional herbal formula oryeongsan water extract on ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal injury in rats.
23118790|a|This study was performed to evaluate the protective effect and safety of Oryeongsan water extract (OSWE) on ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal injury and an acute toxicity study in rats. Acute gastric lesions were induced via intragastric oral administration of absolute ethanol at a dose of 5   mL/kg. OSWE (100 and 200   mg/kg) was administered to rats 2   h prior to the oral administration of absolute ethanol. The stomach of animal models was opened and gastric mucosal lesions were examined. Gastric mucosal injuries were evaluated by measuring the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. In the acute toxicity study, no adverse effects of OSWE were observed at doses up to 2000   mg/kg/day. Administration of OSWE reduced the damage by conditioning the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced acute gastric injury, which included hemorrhage, hyperemia, and loss of epithelial cells. The level of MDA was reduced in OSWE-treated groups compared with the ethanol-induced group. Moreover, the level of GSH and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were significantly increased in the OSWE-treated groups. Our findings suggest that OSWE has a protective effect on the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced acute gastric injury via the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes.

9065635|t|Acoustic evaluation of the efficacy of medical therapy for allergic nasal obstruction.
9065635|a|Acoustic rhinometry (AR) was used for objective measurements of nasal cavity dimensions in conjunction with a 100-mm horizontal visual analogue scale (VAS) for simultaneous subjective assessments of nasal sensations of airflow. Studies were conducted on 45 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis before, during and after a 2-week period of treatment with oral emedastine difumarate, azelastine hydrochloride, and xiao qing long tang (a homeopathic decongestant), as well as intranasal fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. During the treatment period, there was a significant increase in the right and left minimum cross-sectional areas (MCA) of the nose and/or nasal cavity volumes (NCV) in all groups. The average increase in MCA ranged from 21-39% after 1 week of treatment and 16-39% after 2 weeks, whereas that in the NCV ranged from 16-24% and 19-24%, respectively. Post-treatment measurements were not significantly different from the corresponding pre-treatment ones. These findings were in close agreement with that obtained with VAS, demonstrating that AR can be used to validate the application of VAS in the evaluation of nasal airflow during medical therapy.

16314688|t|Antinociceptive effect of shakuyakukanzoto, a Kampo medicine, in diabetic mice.
16314688|a|In this study, the antinociceptive effect of shakuyakukanzoto was investigated using streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice to certify its analgesic effect on diabetic patients. Shakuyakukanzoto (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg, p.o.) significantly increased the nociceptive threshold in diabetic mice. The antinociceptive activity of shakuyakukanzoto in diabetic mice was not antagonized by beta-funaltrexamine, naltrindole, or nor-binaltorphimine. The increased antinociceptive activity of (1.0 g/kg, p.o.) in diabetic mice was abolished by yohimbine (15 microg, i.t.), but not by NAN-190 (1 microg, i.t.), methysergide (15 microg, i.t.), or MDL-72222 (15 microg, i.t.). In shakuyakukanzoto diabetic mice treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (20 microg, i.t.) chemically lesioned noradrenergic pathways, shakuyakukanzoto (1.0 g/kg, p.o.) failed to exhibit an antinociceptive effect. Furthermore, the antinociceptive activity induced by norepinephrine (0.06 - 2 microg, i.t.) was markedly more potent in diabetic mice than in non-diabetic mice at the same dose. These results suggest that the antinociceptive effect of shakuyakukanzoto in diabetic mice is not mediated by the opioid systems and that this effect appears via selective activation of the spinal descending inhibitory alpha2-adrenergic systems without activating the serotonergic systems. The spinal alpha2-adrenoceptor-mediated analgesic mechanism was enhanced in diabetic mice, suggesting that shakuyakukanzoto exhibits its effect by activating the descending noradrenergic neurons.

24670676|t|The inhibitory effect of shakuyakukanzoto on K+ current in H9c2 cells.
24670676|a|Shakuyakukanzoto (shao-yao-gan-cao-tang) is a commonly used Chinese traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of acute pain with muscle cramp. However, its mechanism of action is unclear. We previously reported that a low concentration of Kanzo (licorice) and isoliquiritigenin, a component of licorice, inhibited the potassium (K(+)) current in H9c2 cells. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effects of Shakuyakukanzoto, Shakuyaku or Kanzo on the K(+) current (IKur) in H9c2 cells. Shakuyakukanzoto inhibited IKur in a concentration-dependent manner. The half-maximal concentration of Shakuyakukanzoto was approximately 1.3 mg/mL and the Hill coefficient was 1.2. The order of potency of inhibiting IKur was Kanzo>Shakuyakukanzoto>Shakuyaku. Glycyrrhizin, a major component of licorice, had no inhibitory effect on IKur. A small interfering RNA experiment indicated that IKur was most likely to be Kv2.1 in H9c2 cells. Our results suggest that Shakuyakukanzoto may normalize intracellular and extracellular K(+) balance by inhibiting IKur and reducing K(+) efflux, while the Na(+)-K(+) pump promotes K(+) influx into myofibers. Consequently, excess K(+) may be reduced from external space of myofibers. This may be a part of the Shakuyakukanzoto mechanism for improving muscle pain.

18939414|a|We report a case of drug-induced pneumonia associated with the herbal medine Syakuyakukanzo-to. A 82-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of cough, fever, and dyspnea after administration of shakuyakukanzoto for two weeks. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests were negative, but bronchoalveolar lavage showed an increase in lymphocytes with an increased CD4/CD8 ratio. Cessation of the drug improved the patient's clinical and X-ray findings and then he was able to be discharged. He was admitted again for a challenge test. His clinical symptoms and X-ray findings became worse 8 days after re-administration, therefore we diagnosed drug-induced pneumonia caused by Shakuyakukanzoto. He has had no recurrence after discontinuance of the drug. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous case of drug-induced pneumonia due to Shakuyakukanzo-to reported in the world.

23164761|t|Antispasmodic effect of shakuyakukanzoto extract on experimental muscle cramps in vivo: role of the active constituents of Glycyrrhizae radix.
23164761|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Shakuyakukanzoto (SKT) composed of Glycyrrhizae radix (G. radix) and Paeoniae radix (P. radix) has been traditionally used in Japan, Korea and China as an antispasmodic drug for the treatment of skeletal muscle cramps and intestinal cramps. AIM OF THIS STUDY: To evaluate the antispasmodic activity of SKT and its two components, as well as to identify the key constituents of the components which mediate this effect in skeletal muscles in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An experimental cramp model was constructed to evaluate the effects of peripherally-acting muscle relaxants on electrically-induced cramps under physiological conditions. This was accomplished by surgically isolating the motor supply to the gastrocnemius muscle in an anesthetized rat and delivering electrical stimuli to an isolated tibial nerve to induce tetanic contractions. We first tested dantrolene, a well-known peripherally-acting relaxant, to determine the sensitivity and reliability of our experimental model. We then evaluated the effects of SKT, P. radix, G. radix, and the eight active constituents of G. radix against tetanic contractions. RESULTS: We found that dantrolene (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.d.) rapidly and significantly inhibited tetanic contractions (P<0.01) irrespective of dose. SKT (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg, i.d.) and G. radix (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg, i.d.) also significantly inhibited tetanic contractions (P<0.01) but in a dose-dependent manner owing to the actions of six of the eight active constituents in G. radix (liquiritin apioside, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritin apioside, isoliquiritigenin, glycycoumarin, and glycyrrhetinic acid, 20  mol/kg, i.v.). These constituents, which include flavonoids, a triterpenoid, and a courmarin derivative, demonstrated temporal variations in their inhibitory activity. In contrast, P. radix (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg, i.d.) did not show a statistically significant antispasmodic effect in our study; however, we previously found that it had a significant antinociceptive effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that SKT inhibits tetanic contractions in vivo and that G. radix is the main antispasmodic component due to the actions of its active constituents, thus supporting the traditional use of SKT. We further propose that SKT containing the antispasmodic G. radix and antinociceptive P. radix is a pharmaceutically elegant option for muscle cramps as treatment requires a two-pronged approach, i.e., inhibition of hyperexcitable skeletal tissues and modulation of the pain accompanying cramps.

25783410|t|Effects of shakuyakukanzoto and its absorbed components on twitch contractions induced by physiological Ca(2+) release in rat skeletal muscle.
25783410|a|UNASSIGNED: Shakuyakukanzoto (SKT) is a kampo medicine composed of equal proportions of Glycyrrhizae radix (G. radix) and Paeoniae radix (P. radix). A double-blind study reported that SKT significantly ameliorated painful muscle cramp in cirrhosis patients without the typical severe side effects of muscle weakness and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Previous basic studies reported that SKT and its active components induced relaxation by a direct action on skeletal muscle and that SKT did not depress CNS functions; however, why SKT has a lower incidence of muscle weakness remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated which components are absorbed into the blood of rats after a single oral administration of SKT to identify the active components of SKT. We also investigated the effects of SKT and its components on the twitch contraction induced by physiological Ca(2+) release. Our study demonstrated that SKT and five G. radix isolates, which are responsible for the antispasmodic effect of SKT, did not inhibit the twitch contraction in contrast to dantrolene sodium, a direct-acting peripheral muscle relaxant, indicating that the mechanisms of muscle contraction of SKT and dantrolene in skeletal muscle differ. These findings suggest that SKT does not reduce the contractile force in skeletal muscle under physiological conditions, i.e., SKT may have a low risk of causing muscle weakness in clinical use. Considering that most muscle relaxants and anticonvulsants cause various harmful side effects such as weakness and CNS depression, SKT appears to have a benign safety profile.

17202675|t|Isoliquiritigenin, one of the antispasmodic principles of Glycyrrhiza ularensis roots, acts in the lower part of intestine.
17202675|a|Glycyrrhizae radix is used to treat abdominal pain as a component of shakuyakukanzoto (shaoyao-gancao-tang), a traditional Chinese medicine formulation. Previously, we have reported the isolation of glycycoumarin as a potent antispasmodic with an IC50 value of 2.93+/-0.94 microM for carbamylcholine (CCh)-induced contraction of mouse jejunum from an aqueous extract of Glycyrrhizae radix (licorice), and clarified that its mechanism of action involves inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3. The purpose of the present study was to examine an antispasmodic principle of licorice other than glycycoumarin. Isoliquiritigenin was isolated from an aqueous extract of licorice as a potent relaxant, which inhibited the contraction induced by various types of stimulants, such as CCh, KCl, and BaCl2 with IC50 values of 4.96+/-1.97 microM, 4.03+/-1.34 microM and 3.70+/-0.58 microM, respectively, which are close to those of papaverine. However, the amount of isoliquiritigenin in the aqueous extract of licorice was very small. When the aqueous licorice extract was treated with naringinase, the amounts of glycosides such as isoliquiritin, which were abundant but had much less potent relaxant activity, were decreased while isoliquiritigenin was increased. At the time, the relaxant activity of the treated sample was increased significantly, shifting the IC50 from 358+/-104 to 150+/-38 microg/ml for CCh-induced contraction. Isoliquiritigenin also showed the most potent inhibition of mouse rectal contraction induced by CCh with an IC50 value of 1.70+/-0.07 microM. These results suggest that isoliquiritigenin acts as a potent relaxant in the lower part of the intestine by transformation from its glycosides.

18570062|t|Clinical trial of treatment with saikokaryukotsuboreito for eugonadal patients with late-inset hypogonadism-related symptoms.
18570062|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saikokaryukotsuboreito (SKRBT), which is widely used for a variety of clinical conditions, neuropsychiatric disorders, for patients with LOH-related symptoms. Twenty-two eugonadal patients over 40 years of age with LOH-related symptoms were included in this study. SKRBT was given orally to these patients three times daily to a total of 7.5 g/day for more than two months. Laboratory and endocrinological profiles were reviewed, and LOH symptoms were judged by means of several health assessment instruments such as the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, Self-rated Depression Scale (SDS), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ). Total AMS scores and AMS subscores were significantly decreased after the treatment. The KHQ, general health perception and impact on life scores were also significantly decreased, although no significant improvement was observed in other KHQ factors or the SDS score or IPSS. The serum concentrations of testosterone fractions did not change with treatment. Laboratory values did not change, and no adverse effects were identified after treatment. We conclude that SKRBT may be considered for treatment of patients with LOH-related symptoms for eugonadal patients.

23339665|t|A Kampo formula, saikokaryukotsuboreito, improves serum testosterone levels of castrated mice and its possible mechanism.
23339665|a|The term "late-onset hypogonadism (LOH)" is recommended to express the symptoms in middle-aged males with decreased testosterone. Although androgen replacement therapy (ART) might be an effective way to manage LOH, the risk of testosterone supplementation in elderly men is still concerned. On the other hand, to avoid adverse effects of ART, Kampo medicine (traditional Chinese-Japanese medicine) is often a first choice to treat LOH in Japan. However, their pharmacological studies are few. In this study, castrated mice was used as an LOH animal model for examining the pharmacological effects of a Kampo formula, saikokaryukotsuboreito (shortly SKRBT) on serum testosterone levels and seminal vesicles weights. Furthermore, an attempt to elucidate its pharmacological mechanism, inhibition of SKRBT and its components against aromatase were also examined with the enzyme-based assay. As a result, SKRBT improved significantly both the decline of serum testosterone levels and decrease of seminal vesicles weight of castrated mice at a dose of 125 mg/kg with a non dose-dependent manner. SKRBT and two components Scutellariae radix and Rhei rhizoma exhibited inhibitory activities with the IC(50) values of 145, 29.2 and 29.7   g/ml, respectively. These results suggested that the aromatase inhibitory activity of SKRBT may contribute, to a different extent, to the improvement of serum testosterone levels.

24587934|t|Effectiveness of saikokaryukotsuboreito (herbal medicine) for antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction in male patients with schizophrenia: a description of two cases.
24587934|a|Antipsychotics sometimes cause sexual dysfunction in people with schizophrenia. The authors report the effectiveness of Saikokaryukotsuboreito (Japanese traditional herbal medicine, Chai-Hu-Jia-Long-Gu-Mu-Li-Tang in Chinese) for antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction in two male patients with schizophrenia. The first patient was a 28-year-old man with schizophrenia who suffered erectile dysfunction induced by olanzapine 10   mg/day; the erectile dysfunction significantly improved following the treatment of Saikokaryukotsuboreito 7.5   g/day. The other case was a 43-year-old man with schizophrenia who was receiving fluphenazine decanoate at 50   mg/month and had difficulties in ejaculation; add-on of Saikokaryukotsuboreito 7.5   g/day recovered his ejaculatory function. There has been no report on the effectiveness of Japanese herbal medicine formulations for antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction. Although the effectiveness of Saikokaryukotsuboreito needs to be tested in systematic clinical trials, this herbal medicine may be a treatment option to consider for this annoying side effect.

25259618|t|A herbal medicine, saikokaryukotsuboreito, improves serum testosterone levels and affects sexual behavior in old male mice.
25259618|a|UNASSIGNED: Late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) is a clinical syndrome characterized with aging and declined serum testosterone levels. Sexual symptoms are also essential for the diagnosis of LOH. Testosterone replacement therapy is used widely to treat LOH. However, the side effects of it should not be ignored, such as fluid retention, hypertension and spermatogenic suppression. Therefore, alternate treatment modalities have been pursued. Herbal medicines used widely in China have achieved satisfying results with little side effects. Nonetheless, there are few pharmacological researches on them. In this study, 24-month-old mice were used as LOH animal models to explore the pharmacological effects of a herbal medicine, saikokaryukotsuboreito (SKRBT), on serum testosterone levels and sexual functions. Furthermore, the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, a kind of rate-limiting enzyme of testosterone synthesis, was also examined. As a result, SKRBT improved the serum testosterone levels of these mice at a dose of 300 and 450   mg/kg. Multiple measures of sexual behavior were enhanced. The expression of StAR was also increased. Therefore, this study suggested that SKRBT can improve the serum testosterone levels by activating the expression of StAR and might be a viable option to treat sexual symptoms caused by LOH.

18663561|t|Saikokaryukotsuboreito, a herbal medicine, prevents chronic stress-induced anxiety in rats: comparison with diazepam.
18663561|a|Anxiety is frequently observed in several neuropsychiatric disorders, and stress is thought to precipitate or exacerbate anxiety. In this study, the anxiolytic action of a herbal medicine, saikokaryukotsuboreito, (SRBT) was examined in normal healthy rats using the elevated plus-maze test. Moreover, the improving effect of SRBT on chronic stress-induced anxiety was also examined. Single administration of SRBT did not have anxiolytic action in normal rats. Repeated administration of SRBT significantly improved chronic stress-induced anxiety. On the other hand, single administration of a typical anxiolytic, diazepam, had anxiolytic action in normal rats but repeated administration did not improve chronic stress-induced anxiety. These results suggest that SRBT does not have anxiolytic activity equivalent to that of diazepam but has potency for improving stress-related anxiety. This finding provides information important for the treatment of anxiety.

19552596|t|Complete recovery from tension-type headache through Kampo medicine.
19552596|a|OBJECTIVE: We administered Kampo medicine for tension-type headache with extremely effective results. The objective is to demonstrate the effect of Kampo medicine. SUBJECT: The case was 13 year-old-girl who had been suffering from headaches from the age of 11 years. As general and neurologic examinations (blood tests, urine analysis, head computed tomography, and electroencephalography) showed no abnormal findings, we diagnosed her as suffering from tension-type headache. Accompanying signs and symptoms included fatigue, shoulder stiffness, and a lot of stress in a private supplementary school and from ballet lessons. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: Kampo medicine was chosen to address the necessity for a comprehensive treatment. We prescribed saikokaryukotsuboreito, with clear positive effect. Although headaches re-appeared when she later forgot to take the formula, the symptom disappeared by taking it again. Treatment was discontinued after 11 months, and the headache has not recurred for 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Kampo medicine was able to improve her overall symptom pattern, as Kampo formulas are selected not only by paying attention to the primary symptom (in this case headache) but also by checking the other characteristics (additional symptoms, constitution, etc). This case showed that Kampo treatment is an effective therapeutic option for tension-type headaches accompanied by various other symptoms.

17250881|t|Saikokaryukotsuboreito, a herbal medicine, prevents chronic stress-induced dysfunction of glucocorticoid negative feedback system in rat brain.
17250881|a|Disruption of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis characterized by dysfunction of the glucocorticoid negative feedback system is frequently observed in human depressives and is thought to involve a reduction in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function in the feedback sites including the brain. Recently, we found that chronic stress in rats induces similar HPA disruption that is caused by abolishment of feedback ability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, which involves decreased cytosolic GRs or increased nuclear GRs, respectively. Also, we found that saikokaryukotsuboreito (SRBT), a herbal medicine, prevents the chronic stress-induced HPA disruption. We therefore examined here the effects of this drug on the chronic stress-induced changes in GRs in the PFC and hippocampus. Chronic stress was induced in rats by water immersion and restraint (2 h/day) for 4 weeks. SRBT significantly prevented decreased cytosolic GRs in the PFC and increased nuclear GRs in the hippocampus in the chronically stressed rats. Moreover, SRBT significantly prevented the abolishment of feedback ability in both regions. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of SRBT on the GR level are involved in its ameliorating actions on the HPA disruption. This finding provides information important for the prevention and treatment of depression.

20712429|t|Change in cytokine levels after administration of saikokaryuukotsuboreito or testosterone in patients with symptoms of late-onset hypogonadism.
20712429|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma cytokine levels after treatment with saikokaryukotsuboreito (SKRBT), which is a herbal medicine, or androgen replacement treatment (ART), for patients with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH)-related symptoms. Thirty-one patients over 40 years of age with LOH-related symptoms were included in this study. SKRBT was given orally three times daily to a total of 7.5 g/day for 15 eugonadal patients and ART was give to 16 hypogonadal patients by intramuscular injection of testosterone enanthate at 125 mg each time every 2 weeks. Plasma levels of testosterone and 18 cytokines, as well as LOH-related symptoms scored according to the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, were compared before and more than 2 months after treatment. In the ART group, the total AMS score was decreased and testosterone was increased significantly after treatment. No cytokine variables were altered significantly after the treatment. In the SKRBT group, although the total AMS score was significantly decreased, testosterone did not change. From the evaluation of cytokines, a significant increase was found in interleukin (IL)- 8, IL-13, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. We conclude that SKRBT might improve LOH-related symptoms in eugonadal patients through the beneficial effect of cytokines, a mechanism that is quite different from ART.

25889685|t|Aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in progressive supranuclear palsy treated with qing fei tang: two case reports.
25889685|a|INTRODUCTION: Qing fei tang, which is used for various respiratory diseases, is useful for reducing relapse of aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in stroke, but the effect remains unknown in Parkinson's syndrome. We report two cases of Japanese patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and relapsing aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, which was successfully prevented by qing fei tang. CASE PRESENTATION: Two Japanese men with progressive supranuclear palsy and receiving total enteral feeding (patient one (66-years-old) and patient two (76-years-old)) had experienced recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia, which was unresponsive to conventional therapy. The respiratory infection developed twice at intervals of two months in patient one, and nine times at almost monthly intervals in patient two. Thereafter, they were given qing fei tang. After administration of qing fei tang, the respiratory infection reoccurred only once; after 5.5 months for patient one, and six months for patient two. Both of our patients clearly showed a reduced incidence of respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: Both of our patients clearly showed a reduced incidence of respiratory infection after the administration of qing fei tang. Qing fei tang could be useful for the prevention of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in progressive supranuclear palsy.

10374247|t|Effects of qing fei tang (TJ-90) on aspiration pneumonia in mice.
10374247|a|The effects of Qing Fei Tang (Sei-hai To in Japanese), a Chinese traditional medical mixture, on aspiration pneumonia were studied using mice inoculated with both Streptococcus pneumoniae and gastric juice as aspiration pneumoniae models. Daily (4 weeks) oral usage of Qing Fei Tang before inoculation reduced remarkably the mortality rate of mice. In this aspiration pneumonia model, xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the lung tissues was elevated, but this elevation was remarkably decreased by use of Qing Fei Tang. These results suggest that Qing Fei Tang pretreatment can reduce oxygen radical production in inflammed lungs and may reduce the mortality for aspiration pneumonia.

19051351|t|Kampo medicine, based on traditional medicine theory, in treating uncured glossodynia: efficacy in five clinical cases.
19051351|a|Glossodynia, or tongue pain, is resistant to conventional therapies. Kampo medicines were evaluated in patients suffering from incurable glossodynia. Patients were diagnosed by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory in order to determine the appropriate herbal prescriptions. Five Japanese females (50-76 years old) with glossodynia refractory to conventional therapy were enrolled in this study. Small portions of rikkunshito, jiinkokato, hachimijiogan and ryutanshakanto worked for a female diagnosed with "Spleen" and "Heart" Yin deficiency, "Kidney" Yang deficiency and "Liver" Qi stagnation producing heat syndrome. Seishoekkito and bakumondoto were effective for a patient diagnosed with "Spleen Qi" deficiency and "Stomach" Yin deficiency producing heat syndrome. Rikkunshito, kamikihito and chikujountanto worked for a patient diagnosed with "Spleen Qi" and "Heart Yin" deficiency, stagnation of "Liver" Qi producing fire and "Gallbladder" Qi deficiency. Rokumijiogan, kamishoyosan and kambakutaisoto were effective for a patient with Yang rise based on Yin deficiency of "Kidney" and "Liver," and restless organ disorder based on Yin deficiency of 5 viscera. A patient diagnosed with "Spleen" Yang deficiency responded to a combination of anchusan and hangeshashinto. These patients with glossodynia had resolution of pain within 1 month of treatment. Herbal mixtures containing Ganoderam lucidum, not prescribed based on TCM theory, but effective for herpes virus infection, worked for a female suffering from glossodynia for 1 year after artificial teeth were placed, but required about 5 months to note improvement. Kampo medicines, properly prescribed based on TCM theory, quickly resolved the pain of refractory glossodynia.

23128098|t|Occurrence of chai hu (Bupleuri radix) in prescriptions of Chinese herbal medicine in Switzerland.
23128098|a|BACKGROUND: Chai hu (Bupleuri radix), one of the most frequently used herbs in Chinese herbal medicine, has 3 major functions, depending on dosage and combination with other herbs. The aim of this study was to investigate how chai hu is prescribed in everyday practice in Switzerland, and whether these prescription patterns reflect its various applications. METHODS: A random sample of 1,053 prescriptions was drawn from the database of Lian Chinaherb AG, Wollerau, Switzerland, and analyzed regarding the most frequently used classical formulas containing chai hu, daily dosages and combinations with other herbs. RESULTS: 29.0% of all prescriptions contained chai hu, and 98.0% of these were in granular form. The most frequently used classical formulas were xiao yao san ('rambling powder'), jia wei xiao yao san ('augmented rambling powder') and chai hu shu gan san ('Bupleurum powder to spread the liver'). In more than half of the prescriptions, chai hu was combined with bai shao (Paeoniae Radix Alba), dang gui (Angelicae sinensis radix) or fu ling (Poria). 51.8% of the prescriptions contained a low daily dosage of chai hu, 24.9% a medium and 15.1% a high dosage. CONCLUSION: Chai hu was generally prescribed in classic combinations with other herbs and in a medium dosage. Due to the addition of supplementary herbs to classical formulas, its daily dose was often diminished from a high or medium dose to a low dose. This raises the question if chai hu would then still exert its desired function of, e.g., moving liver-qi in these prescriptions.

24250714|t|High-frequency ultrasound imaging to evaluate liver fibrosis progression in rats and yi guan jian herbal therapeutic effects.
24250714|a|The animals used in liver fibrosis studies must usually be sacrificed. Ultrasound has been demonstrated to have the ability to diagnose hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in experimental small-animal models. However, few studies have used high-frequency ultrasound (HFU, 40   MHz) to monitor changes in the rat liver and other hollow organs longitudinally. In this study, liver fibrosis was induced by administering dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) in SD rats, aged 8 weeks, for three consecutive days per week for up to 4 weeks. A Chinese herbal medicine Yi Guan Jian (YGJ) was orally administered (1.8   g/kg daily) to DMN-induced liver fibrosis rats for 2 weeks. Compared with the normal control rats, rats treated with DMN for either 2 weeks or 4 weeks had significantly lower body weights, liver indexes and elevation of hydroxyproline, GOT, and GPT contents. YGJ herbal treatment remarkably prevented rats from DMN-induced liver fibrosis. The HFU scoring results among the normal controls, 2-week DMN-treated rats, 4-week DMN-treated rats, and combined 2-week YGJ therapy with 4-week DMN-treated rats also reached statistical significance. Thus, HFU is an accurate tool for the longitudinal analysis of liver fibrosis progression in small-animal models, and the YGJ may be useful in reversing the development of hepatic fibrosis.

2598351|a|15-18 month-old Wistar rats were selected and placed in 41 degrees C chamber for 12 hours. 10% Shen Mai San granule was poured into the stomachs every 3 hours. The preventive effects of this drug on heatstroke were observed. The result showed that the mortality of animal was decreased, the exhaustions of myocardial creatine phosphate and cAMP contents were significantly mitigated. By the view point of western medicine, the mechanisms recorded in traditional Chinese medicine about the preventive actions of this drug on heatstroke were also discussed in this study. The authors considered that the effects of Shen Mai San on "strengthening pulmonary Qi", "strengthening Heart Qi", might be concerned in its efficiency to stabilize the energy store in myocardium, and it might be beneficial to prevent the elderly from heatstroke.

27631428|t|Ephedra Herb extract activates/desensitizes transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and reduces capsaicin-induced pain.
27631428|a|UNASSIGNED: Kampo medicines containing Ephedra Herb (EH) such as eppikajutsubuto and makyoyokukanto are used to treat myalgia, arthralgia, and rheumatism. The analgesic effects of these Kampo medicines are attributed to the anti-inflammatory action of EH. However, the molecular mechanism of the analgesic effect of EH remains to be clarified. In this study, the effects of EH extract (EHE) on transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a nonselective ligand-gated cation channel, which plays an essential role in nociception on sensory neurons, were investigated using mTRPV1/Flp-In293 cells (stable mouse TRPV1-expressing transfectants). Administration of EHE increased the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in these cells, which was inhibited by the TRPV1 antagonist, N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,2-dihydro-4-(3-chloropyridine-2-yl) tetrahydropyrazine-1-carboxamide (BCTC), indicating that EHE activated TRPV1. Examination of EHE-induced nociceptive pain in vivo revealed that an intradermal (i.d.) injection of EHE into the hind paw of mice induced paw licking, a pain-related behavior, and that the extract increased paw licking times in a dose-dependent manner. The EHE-induced paw licking was also inhibited by BCTC. An i.d. injection of EHE 30  min before administration of capsaicin decreased capsaicin-induced paw licking times. Similarly, oral administration of the extract also suppressed capsaicin-induced paw licking, without affecting the physical performance of the mice. These results suggest that EHE suppresses capsaicin-induced paw licking by regulating TRPV1 activity. Thus, the antinociceptive effects of EHE seem to be produced by its direct action on sensory neurons through TRPV1.

18981582|t|Effect of bakumijiogan, an herbal formula in traditional Chinese medicine, on atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions induced by mite antigen in NC/Jic mice.
18981582|a|We evaluated the effectiveness of bakumijiogan (BJG), an herbal formula in traditional Chinese medicine used to treat atopic dermatitis (AD), using a NC/Jic mouse model of AD. AD symptoms were induced by repeated injections of Dermatophagoides farinae antigen (Df-antigen) into the ear auricle at 2- to 3-d intervals for 16 d. Ear thickness dramatically increased up to 16 d after the first injection of Df-antigen. Daily oral administration of BJG from 7 d before to 16 d after the first injection significantly reduced ear swelling. Serum concentrations of total immunoglobulin (Ig)E and Df-antigen-specific IgG1 were augmented when assayed 17 d after the first injection of Df-antigen, and these increases were slightly suppressed by BJG administration. Serum interferon (IFN)-gamma and lesional IFN-gamma mRNA levels were significantly higher, whereas lesional IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA levels were lower in BJG-treated mice than those in control mice. These results suggest that BJG suppressed AD-like symptoms by correcting the Th1/Th2 imbalance skewed toward Th2. Evaluation of herbal constituents in BJG revealed that the combination of two herbal ingredients, ophiopogon tuber and schisandra fruit, mainly contributed to the effects of BJG.

The results of this experiment show that LWDHT can increase markedly the number of lymphocytes, mainly T lymphocytes, in tumor-bearing mice. Free-flow electrophoresis shows that in tumor-bearing mice the electrophoretic characteristics of T lymphocytes are changed, i.e., reduction of the number of T lymphocytes with a higher electrophoretic rate, but LWDHT can alleviate this disorder. Study on the cell membrane fluidity of carcinoma cells in EAC mice demonstrates that LWDHT can decrease the cell membrane fluidity, suggesting that it can inhibit division of carcinoma cells.

16260405|a|INTRODUCTION: We previously demonstrated the hemostatic effects of notoginseng using a rat bleeding model. Yun-Nan-Bai-Yao is a proprietary product for external use in China to treat bleeding but the hemostatic effects have not been proven. This study was conducted to compare the hemostatic effects of notoginseng to that of Yun-Nan- Bai-Yao and placebo control. METHODS: Rats (n = 37) were randomized into 3 groups and their tails were transected 5mm from the tip in this blinded investigation. Group 1 received placebo (wheat flour, n = 17), group 2 received notoginseng (n = 10) and group 3 received the Yun-Nan-Bai-Yao (n = 10). The total bleeding time was determined and compared among groups. RESULTS: Beeding time in minutes was 29.7% and 22.3% lower in the notoginseng and Yun-Nan-Bai-Yao groups than the placebo group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was found between the two active groups (p = 0.418). CONCLUSIONS: When applied externally, both notoginseng and Yun-Nan-Bai-Yao provide appreciable hemostatic effects compared to placebo.

11360485|t|[Cellular mechanism of seizure discharge and its normalization by a herbal mixture prescription "saikokeishito-ka-shakuyaku" (SK)].
11360485|a|Epilepsy is one of the most frequently occurring nervous diseases. However, the fundamental cause of epilepsy is still unclear. We tried to elucidate the cellular mechanism of seizure discharge. During this research we unexpectedly found that a herbal mixture prescription shows very good effects on epileptics. Therefore, we also performed experiments on the anticonvulsant mechanism of this herbal mixture prescription, "Saikokeishito-ka-Shakuyaku" (SK). SK showed normalizing effects on intracellular calcium-related and protein-related pathological changes induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) application in snail neurons and cultured neurons from the cerebral cortex of mice. In addition, SK showed marked protective effects against neuron damage induced by the cobalt focus epilepsy model, cytochalasin B and severe stress. SK also showed normalizing effects on developmental defects of cultured neurons from the cerebral cortex of an epilepsy animal model, EL mice. Moreover, SK showed complete preventive effects on the abnormal expression of one of the seizure-related (SEZ) genes, PTZ-17, induced by PTZ in Xenopus oocytes injected with PTZ-17 RNA. We also determined mouse chromosomal loci of the SEZ gene group and PTZ sensitive trait loci by linkage analysis for comparison with human synteny of epileptic families. The above-mentioned findings suggest that some herbal prescriptions will become promising drugs for the therapy against intractable nervous diseases which can not be ameliorated by pure chemical drugs in the future.

17449963|t|Suppressive effect of herbal medicine saikokeishito on acinar cell apoptosis in rat spontaneous chronic pancreatitis.
17449963|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by acinar destruction and fibrosis. We previously reported that apoptosis is involved in acinar destruction in chronic pancreatitis in the WBN/Kob rat. This study aimed to elucidate the antiapoptotic effect of Saikokeishito (TJ-10). METHODS: Four-week-old male WBN/Kob rats were fed a special pellet diet (MB-3) with or without TJ-10 (80 mg/100 g body weight) for 20 weeks. Pancreas was histopathologically examined every 4 weeks, and the expression of apoptosis-related factors such as Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA and protein was analyzed with RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was detected with a TUNEL method. RESULTS: In untreated WBN/Kob rats, chronic pancreatitis developed at 12 weeks and progressed with marked acinar cell destruction at 16 weeks. The expression of Fas and FasL peaked at 12 and 20 weeks. An apoptotic index in acinar cells correlated to the expression of Fas and FasL mRNA. However, in the TJ-10-treated rats, the rate of pancreatic acinar cell destruction, the apoptotic index at 12-20 weeks, and the expression of Fas and FasL at 12 and 20 weeks decreased significantly compared to those in untreated rats. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TJ-10 has a therapeutic effect on chronic pancreatitis by the suppression of acinar cell apoptosis via the Fas/FasL system.

17409635|t|Chotosan, a kampo formula, ameliorates chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced deficits in object recognition behaviors and central cholinergic systems in mice.
17409635|a|We previously demonstrated that the Kampo formula chotosan (CTS) ameliorated spatial cognitive impairment via central cholinergic systems in a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (P2VO) mouse model. In this study, the object discrimination tasks were used to determine if the ameliorative effects of CTS on P2VO-induced cognitive deficits are a characteristic pharmacological profile of this formula, with the aim of clarifying the mechanisms by which CTS enhances central cholinergic function in P2VO mice. The cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine (THA) and Kampo formula saikokeishito (SKT) were used as controls. P2VO impaired object discrimination performance in the object recognition, location, and context tests. Daily administration of CTS (750 mg/kg, p.o.) and THA (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) improved the object discrimination deficits, whereas SKT (750 mg/kg, p.o.) did not. In ex vivo assays, tacrine but not CTS or SKT inhibited cortical cholinesterase activity. P2VO reduced the mRNA expression of m(3) and m(5) muscarinic receptors and choline acetyltransferase but not that of other muscarinic receptor subtypes in the cerebral cortex. Daily administration of CTS and THA but not SKT reversed these expression changes. These results suggest that CTS and THA improve P2VO-induced cognitive impairment by normalizing the deficit of central cholinergic systems and that the beneficial effect on P2VO-induced cognitive deficits is a distinctive pharmacological characteristic of CTS.

25793006|t|Suan zao ren tang in combination with zhi zi chi tang as a treatment protocol for insomniacs with anxiety: a randomized parallel-controlled trial.
25793006|a|Insomnia is a serious worldwide health problem that is often comorbid with anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a Chinese formula containing Suan Zao Ren Tang (SZRT) and Zhi Zi Chi Tang (ZZCT; SZR-ZZC) for improving sleep quality and anxiety states with four indices of Polysomnography (PSG), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Methods. A randomized, parallel-controlled trial compared SZR-ZZC to lorazepam tablet in insomniacs with anxiety. Patients were randomized to the SZR-ZZC treatment group (n = 60) and the lorazepam tablet treatment group (n = 59). Results. SZR-ZZC significantly improved scores on all four treatment indices. Compared with lorazepam, treatment with SZR-ZZC resulted in a significant reduction in the ISI (P = 0.029), the PSQI (P = 0.017), and wake after sleep onset (WASO; P = 0.008) scores and improved sleep architecture (P = 0.000-0.003) after a 4-week treatment period. Only one subject in the SZR-ZZC group experienced adverse side effects. Conclusion. Treatment with SZR-ZZC for 4 weeks appears to be a relatively safe and effective complementary therapeutic option when aiming to improve sleep quality and anxiety in insomniacs with anxiety.

1340518|t|Effect of traditional Chinese herbal medicines on the pharmacokinetics of western drugs in Sprague-Dawley rats of different ages (II): Aminophylline-huan shao tan and aminophylline-pu chung yi chi tang.
1340518|a|The effect of Chinese herbal medicines (Huan Shao Tan and Pu Chung Yi Chi Tang) and western drugs (sodium phenobarbital and cimetidine) on the serum concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline and cytochrome P-450 of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of three different ages were examined. The older rats without pretreatment with Chinese herbal medicines and western drugs exhibited higher serum theophylline concentration and lower pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline than middle-aged and younger rats (P < 0.05), but there was no difference in cytochrome P-450 activity among the three different ages of rats. All rats when pretreated with sodium phenobarbital showed lower serum theophylline concentration and higher pharmacokinetics parameters of theophylline. Also, the activity of cytochrome P-450 was higher (P < 0.05). When cimetidine was pre-administered in SD rats of three age groups, all rats exhibited lower serum theophylline concentration and higher pharmacokinetics parameters (P < 0.05), but the activity of cytochrome P-450 remained unchanged (P > 0.05). The results were opposite to other studies, probably because the dose and dosing intervals were different. No single effect occurred on the younger and middle-aged rats after pretreatment with Huan Shao Tan and Pu Chung Yi Chi Tang: their serum theophylline concentration, pharmacokinetics parameters and cytochrome P-450 activity were the same as the control group. However, the older rats after pretreatment with Huan Shao Tan or Pu Chung Yi Chi Tang showed lower serum theophylline concentration and higher pharmacokinetics parameters than the younger and middle-aged rats pretreated with similar Chinese herbal medicines. This indicates that Huan Shao Tan and Pu Chung Yi Chi Tang may perhaps improve the elimination of theophylline in older rats. This might be attributed to the increase in hepatic blood flow or in liver volume, since the activity of cytochrome P-450 was not affected by the administration of Chinese herbal medicines.

19483319|t|Effect of a Kampo preparation, byakkokaninjinto, on pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline.
19483319|a|The effect on the bioavailability of the antimicrobial agents (ciprofloxacin and tetracycline), which are well known to form chelates with cationic metals such as calcium, was evaluated in 20 healthy male volunteers according to an open, random crossover fashion using a Kampo preparation, byakkokaninjinto (TJ-34) which contains various cationic metals including calcium. Each subject received a single oral dose of tetracycline (250 mg) alone or ciprofloxacin (200 mg) alone along with a single coadministration of one pack (3 g) of the Kampo preparation, at one-week intervals. Concentrations of the drugs in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC. Concomitant administration of the Kampo preparation significantly decreased the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC), but not time to reach C(max) (T(max)), of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline. However, the decrease in bioavailability of ciprofloxacin was slight (15%) compared with that of tetracycline (30%). The Kampo preparation significantly decreased the urinary recovery of tetracycline, but not ciprofloxacin, and it had no effect on the renal clearance of either ciprofloxacin or tetracycline. These results indicate that the Kampo preparation tested in this study reduces the extent of bioavailability of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, but not renal excretion, by decreasing the gastrointestinal absorption due to the formation of insoluble chelates with calcium. We recommend that the dose timing of the Kampo preparation should be carefully controlled to avoid therapeutic failure especially for patients receiving the treatment with tetracycline.

21901498|t|Mechanism of drug interaction between a Kampo medicine, byakkokaninjinto, and tetracycline in rats.
21901498|a|We have previously reported that concomitant oral administration of the Kampo medicine, byakkokaninjinto (TJ-34), in extract granules, reduced the plasma concentrations of tetracycline (TC) and ciprofloxacin in humans, which might be the result of forming a chelate with Ca(2+). In the present study, we investigated the effect of a chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), on the plasma concentration-time profiles of TC after coadministration of TJ-34 dried extract and TC in rats to clarify whether metal ions contained in the TJ-34 dried extract contribute to this interaction. TJ-34 dried extract significantly reduced the plasma concentration of TC. The values of maximum concentration (C (max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve and percentage of urinary recovery (f (e)) of TC were reduced to 42%, 40%, and 45%, respectively. On the other hand, treatment with EDTA significantly counteracted the effect of TJ-34 dried extract to reduce absorption of TC, indicating that metal ions mainly account for the interaction. Next, we investigated the effect of staggered administration of TJ-34 dried extract and TC to avoid the drug interaction between them. Administration of TJ-34 dried extract 2  h before TC had no effect on plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of TC. These results provide a precise mechanism of the interaction TJ-34 and TC, suggesting a safe and effective dosage regimen to coadminister TJ-34 and TC in clinical use.

23818936|t|The efficacy study on si ni san freeze-dried powder on sleep phase in insomniac and normal rats.
23818936|a|Objectives. To investigate the effect of Si Ni San freeze-dried powder (SNSP) on sleep phase in insomniac and normal rats, to identify its mode of action in improving sleep, and to provide a reliable method for determining pharmacodynamic material basis of Si-Ni-San on improving sleep. Methods. Rats were deprived of sleep by using the footplate electrical stimulator to record the rats' electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) by using polysomnography (PSG) and copy insomnia model by the method of electric stimulation. Analysis on EEG and EMG was carried out to observe the effects of SNSP on the sleep phase of insomniac and normal rats. Results. Rats were treated by intragastric administration (i.g.) consecutively for seven days. The results showed that the total sleep time was extended; meanwhile, SWS2 (P < 0.01) and REMS (P < 0.05) were mainly prolonged for both insomniac and normal rats. The dates implied SNSP could significantly improve sleep. Conclusions. SNSP could prolong SWS2 and REMS, the experimental reproducibility is good, and the dates indicate that SNSP has the sedative function. Study on the effects of SNSP on sleep phases provided a basis for the further studies on effective constituents and the pharmacodynamic mechanism of SNSP.

20410594|t|Preventive effects of a kampo medicine, orento on inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide treated human gingival fibroblasts.
20410594|a|In the present study, we investigated the effects of a Kampo medicine Orento (TJ-120) on the production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 by human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) treated with lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PgLPS). HGFs proliferation was dose-dependently decreased with Orento at days 3 and 7. However, treatment with PgLPS (10 ng/ml), Orento (up to 1 mg/ml) and their combinations for 24 h did not affect the viability of HGFs. Orento suppressed PgLPS-induced PGE(2) production in a dose-dependent manner but did not alter basal PGE(2) level. In contrast, Orento did not alter PgLPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 productions. These alterations by Orento were similar to those by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK/MEK) inhibitor, PD98059. A Orento showed no effect on cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 activities, and increased cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) expression and increased PgLPS-induced COX-2 expression. Orento suppressed PgLPS-induced mobility retardation of cPLA(2) band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, that is cPLA(2) phosphorylation and its activation, while Orento alone did not alter cPLA(2) phosphorylation. Orento suppressed PgLPS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, which is known to lead to ERK activation and cPLA(2) phosphorylation. These results suggest that Orento decreased PGE(2) production by inhibition of cPLA(2) phosphorylation and its activation via inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, and also that Orento may be useful to improve gingival inflammation in periodontal disease.

14992541|t|The effect of herbal medicine on nerve growth factor in estradiol valerate-induced polycystic ovaries in rats.
14992541|a|A type of polycystic ovary resembling some aspects of human polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) can be induced in the rat with a single injection of long-acting estradiol valerate. Among several theories behind the development of polycystic ovaries (PCO), the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system draws much attention, and herbal medicine is known to relieve the abnormal symptoms of PCO. Two herbal formulas, Changbudodam-Tang (cang fu dao tan tang) and Yongdamsagan-Tang (long dan xie gan tang), were used in the present study. The administration of herbal medicine was done every other day for 60 days. The morphological changes of ovaries from herbal medicine treatment were compared to those from an oil-treated control group and an estradiol valerate-injected group. This study also examined the possible hypothesis of neurogenic participation in terms of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the pathology of ovarian dysfunction. The nerve growth factor was analyzed in the central nervous system and ovaries by immunohistochemistry. The main findings of the present study were: (1) PCO were fully developed in rats with a single intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate, (2) PCO resulted in the expression of NGF in the ovaries and the brain tissues, and (3) herbal medicine administration significantly decreased the elevated NGF staining in the ovaries without affecting the brain tissues significantly.

27110721|t|Analysis and Management of Rectal Gas with Kampo Formulas During Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer: A Case Series Study.
27110721|a|OBJECTIVES: During intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer, the target, bladder, and rectum positions should be kept constant to reduce adverse events, such as radiation proctitis, and to increase local tumor control. For this purpose, decreasing the rectal contents as much as possible is important. Daisaikoto (DST) and bukuryoingohangekobokuto (BIHKT) are traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) formulas that have been used to treat patients with abdominal bloating or constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the effect of DST and BIHKT on the rectal gas volume during prostate IMRT according to Kampo diagnosis. Five patients were treated with DST or BIHKT at a dose of 5.0 or 7.5   g/d. The volume of rectal gas in 189 megavoltage computed tomographic images taken before each treatment session and the frequency of rectal gas drainage were evaluated before and after DST or BIHKT administration. RESULTS: After DST or BIHKT treatment, the mean volume of rectal gas was reduced from 6.4 to 2.1   mL, and the mean frequency of gas drainage decreased from 43% to 9%. CONCLUSIONS: DST and BIHKT appear to be useful in reducing rectal gas, which would help prevent radiation proctitis and improve the local control of prostate cancer with IMRT.

21575105|t|Management of perianal abscess with hainosankyuto in neonates and young infants.
21575105|a|BACKGROUND: Perianal abscess (PA) is a common condition acquired in infancy, yet its treatment method remains controversial. We reviewed the outcome of neonates and young infants with PA who were treated with the traditional Japanese medicine, hainosankyuto (TJ-122). METHODS: Fifteen male infants with PA under the age of 3 months were reviewed. The median age of infants at disease onset was 33 days (range, 18-88 days) and the median bodyweight was 4.1 kg (range, 2.5-6.4 kg). TJ-122 was administered at a dose of 0.20 g/kg/day (n= 13) or 0.25 g/kg/day (n= 2) orally in two or three divided doses before meals. Antibiotics were not used in any of the patients. RESULTS: Of the 15 patients, 14 were cured and had no recurrence, with a median TJ-122 administration of 28 days (range, 14-117 days). Eight patients were cured within 28 days (53%) and 12 were cured within 60 days (80%). One patient, who was later diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency, showed incomplete healing of PA with intermittent pus discharge and recurrence. The patient was cured by 1 year of age following repeated administration of TJ-122 and juzentaihoto (TJ-48). CONCLUSION: Medical management with TJ-122 was effective in most neonates and young infants with PA. It appears prudent to manage these patients with hainosankyuto before resorting to surgical intervention.

25331231|t|Evaluation of the efficacy of incision and drainage versus hainosankyuto treatment for perianal abscess in infants: a multicenter study.
25331231|a|PURPOSE: We retrospectively compared the short-term outcomes between incision and drainage (ID) and hainosankyuto (TJ-122, Tsumura _ Co, Tokyo, Japan) treatment for perianal abscess (PA) in infants. METHODS: We retrospectively examined 48 consecutive patients (median age 129  days; range 19-330  days) who presented with PA over a 3  year period. Group 1 comprised 26 patients who were treated with ID at presentation, and Group 2 comprised 22 patients who were treated with oral TJ-122 at presentation; oral treatment was continued until the disappearance of purulent discharge and resolution of induration at the abscess site. RESULTS: PAs were identified in all 48 patients at presentation. The median duration of follow-up was 26  months (range 13-40  months). At presentation, there were no differences in the gender, age, birth weight, duration of symptoms, skin erosion or prevalence of diarrhea between the two groups. Purulent discharge resolved within a median period of 26  days (range 7-42  days) in Group 2, but persisted for 40  days (range 4-196  days) in Group 1. The induration resolved within a median period of 39  days (range 7-91  days) in Group 2, but persisted for 70  days (range 4-308  days) in Group 1 (p  =  0.04). CONCLUSIONS: TJ-122 treatment was more beneficial than ID in treating PA in infants.

21799792|t|Protective effect of hainosankyuto, a traditional Japanese medicine, on Streptococcus pyogenes infection in murine model.
21799792|a|BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) causes various serious diseases including necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. One serious problem observed recently with S. pyogenes therapy is attenuation of the antibiotic effect, especially penicillin treatment failure and macrolide resistance. Hainosankyuto, a traditional Japanese medicine based on ancient Chinese medicine, has been used for treatment of infectious purulent diseases in Japan. In this study, we investigated the protective and therapeutic efficacy of Hainosankyuto against S. pyogenes-skin infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A broth microdilution method revealed that Hainosankyuto did not show a direct anti-bacterial effect against S. pyogenes. Force-feeding Hainosankyuto to infected mice for 4 consecutive days increased the survival rate and reduced the size of local skin lesions compared with mice fed PBS. Although we did not find the significant recovery of survival rate in Hainosankyuto administration only after S. pyogenes infection, the sizes of ulcer lesion were significant smaller after Hainosankyuto administration compared with mice fed PBS. No difference was observed in the anti-bacterial effect of Hainosankyuto between macrolide-susceptible and -resistant strains. Blood bactericidal assay showed that the survival rate of S. pyogenes using the blood from Hainosankyuto-treated mice was lower than that using the blood from untreated mice. We also found increased levels of IL-12, IFN-y and a decreased level of TNF-a in the serum of S. pyogenes-infected mice treated with Hainosankyuto. Mouse peritoneal macrophage from Hainosankyuto-treated mice had significant phagocytic activity and increased mRNA levels of IL-12, IFN-y and decreased mRNA level of TNF-a compared with control macrophage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Hainosankyuto increased survival rate after S. pyogenes infection and up-regulated both blood bactericidal activity and macrophage phagocytic activity through modulation of inflammatory cytokines. Our data also suggest Hainosankyuto may be useful for the treatment of S. pyogenes infection more prophylactically than therapeutically.

Oil Red O staining and intracellular cholesterol analyses were used to quantify cellular cholesterol levels. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase assay was used to measure enzyme activity. The levels of phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinases and products of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis were measured by Western blot analysis. Thirty rats were either ovariectomized or sham-operated and randomly assigned to four groups (n = 5)-Sham, OVX, OVX-SV, or OVX-PMW (50, 150, or 450 mg/kg) group-for 8 weeks. A number of targets associated with lipid-related diseases were examined to confirm the estrogenic effects of palmiwon. RESULTS: Palmiwon showed antiestrogenic activity in MCF-7 cells. Palmiwon decreased lipid accumulation, total cholesterol levels, and low-density lipoprotein/very-low-density lipoprotein levels in HepG2 cells. Moreover, palmiwon reversed the effects of methyl-b-cyclodextrin on cholesterol synthesis regulators and inhibited the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase was stimulated by palmiwon. In ovariectomized rats, palmiwon reduced retroperitoneal and perirenal fat accumulation, serum lipids, atherogenic index, cardiac risk factor score, intima-media thickness, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis scores. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that palmiwon inhibits lipid accumulation without estrogenic activity in the breast. Therefore, palmiwon may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in postmenopausal women.

26703073|t|Boiogito, a Kampo medicine, improves hydrarthrosis in a rat model of knee osteoarthritis.
26703073|a|BACKGROUND: Hydrarthrosis, which is associated with knee pain and limited range of motion, decreases the quality of life (QOL) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). The Kampo medicine boiogito is prescribed for the treatment of knee OA with hydrarthrosis; however, its precise mechanisms of action remain unknown. The purposes of this study were to assess the pharmacological effects of boiogito and its mechanisms of action on joint effusion in rats with surgically induced OA. METHODS: A rat OA model was produced by transecting the anterior (cranial) cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and medial meniscus in the right knee joints of 7-week-old female Wistar rats. The rats were given chow containing boiogito (1 or 2  %) or indomethacin (0.002  %) for 4  weeks after surgical transection. Levels of interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Knee joint pain was assessed using an incapacitance tester. Osmotic water permeability in cultured rabbit synovial cells was assessed using stopped-flow analysis. RESULTS: Increased synovial fluid volume and knee joint pain were observed in rats with surgically induced OA. In rats with OA, levels of IL-1b and HA in the articular cavity were higher but concentration of HA in synovial fluid was lower than in sham-operated rats, suggesting excessive synovial fluid secretion. Administration of boiogito improved hydrarthrosis, IL-1b, and HA concentrations and alleviated knee joint pain in rats with OA. Indomethacin reduced IL-1b and knee joint pain but failed to improve hydrarthrosis or HA concentration in rats with OA. Osmotic water permeability in synovial cells, which is related to the function of the water channel aquaporin, was decreased by treatment with boiogito. CONCLUSION: Boiogito ameliorates the increased knee joint effusion in rats with OA by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b production in the articular cavity and regulating function of water transport in the synovium. The improvement of hydrarthrosis by boiogito results in the increased HA concentration in synovial fluid, thus reducing joint pain. Boiogito may be a clinically useful treatment of QOL in patients with OA with hydrarthrosis.

23662155|t|Significance of Kampo, Japanese traditional medicine, in the treatment of obesity: basic and clinical evidence.
23662155|a|The cause of obesity includes genetic and environmental factors, including cytokines derived from adipocytes (adipo-cytokines). Although drug therapy is available for obesity, it is highly risky. Our main focus in this review is on the traditional form of Japanese medicine, Kampo, in the treated of obesity. Two Kampo formulas, that is, bofutsushosan () and boiogito (), are covered by the national health insurance in Japan for the treatment of obesity. Various issues related to their action mechanisms remain unsolved. Considering these, we described the results of basic experiments and presented clinical evidence and case reports on osteoarthritis as examples of clinical application of their two Kampo medicine. Traditional medicine is used not only for treatment but also for prevention. In clinical practice, it is of great importance to prove the efficacy of combinations of traditional medicine and Western medicine and the utility of traditional medicine in the attenuation of adverse effects of Western medicine.

27046953|t|Components of Boiogito Suppress the Progression of Hypercholesterolemia and Fatty Liver Induced by High-Cholesterol Diet in Rats.
27046953|a|BACKGROUND: Ogi, one main component of boiogito (BOT), is reported to have an effect on hypercholesterolemia and NAFLD. In this experiment, we examined effects of ogi on the progression of hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver induced by high-cholesterol diet in rats and compared with the effects of ogi combined with ginger or hesperidin. METHODS: Hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver were induced by a high cholesterol diet in rats. Extract of ogi, ogi with hesperidin, and ogi with ginger were added to the high-cholesterol diet, respectively. Ezetimibe was also added to the high-cholesterol diet as a positive control. After 6 and 12 weeks, body, liver and adipose tissue weights, blood chemistry, lipid-related and inflammatory-related factors were examined. RESULTS: The high cholesterol diet increased body, liver and adipose tissue weights, and serum cholesterol concentrations. Ogi, ogi with hesperidin or ginger and ezetimibe improved them. In the histological examinations, we observed a significant improvement after treatment. The lipid-related factors (RBP4, HFABP and CFABP) were improved by treatment. Biomarkers of cholesterol synthesis (lathosterol) and absorption (campesterol, beta-sitosterol) were lower in the treatment groups. Inflammatory-related factors (MCP1, CCR2 and TNF-alpha) and ICAM-1 were ameliorated after treatment, especially by ogi with ginger. CONCLUSION: Ogi, ogi with hesperidin or ginger have a similar effect of BOT and ezetimibe on hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver. Ogi with ginger reveals a stronger additive effect with no significant difference. However, as for the anti-inflammatory (MCP1, CCR2 and TNF-alpha) and anti-arteriosclerotic (ICAM-1) effects, additive effects of ogi with ginger are more potent than that of ogi alone or ezetimibe.

25445026|t|Choreito formula for BK virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
25445026|a|Therapy for BK virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis (BKV-HC) is limited after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We examined whether choreito, a formula from Japanese traditional Kampo medicine, is effective for treating BKV-HC. Among the children who underwent allogeneic HSCT between October 2006 and March 2014, 14 were diagnosed with BKV-HC (median, 36 days; range, 14-330 days) after HSCT, and six consecutive children received a pharmaceutical-grade medicine, choreito extract granules. The hematuria grade before treatment was significantly higher in the choreito group than in the nonchoreito group (P = 0.018). The duration from therapy to complete resolution was significantly shorter in the choreito group (median, 9 days; range, 4-17 days) than in the nonchoreito group (median, 17 days; range, 15-66 days; P = 0.037). In 11 children with macroscopic hematuria, the duration from treatment to resolution of macroscopic hematuria was significantly shorter in the choreito group than in the nonchoreito group (median, 2 days vs. 11 days; P = 0.0043). The BKV load in urine was significantly decreased a month after choreito administration. No adverse effects related to choreito administration were observed. Choreito may be a safe and considerably promising therapy for the hemostasis of BKV-HC after HSCT.

21432407|t|Gelatin potentiates lead toxicity due to improper preparation of a Chinese tea drug, choreito. A study based on our previously published case report of long-term choreito use.
21432407|a|A woman who had used a Chinese tea drug, choreito, for treatment of chronic renal diseases over years, experienced lead poisoning with blood lead concentration over 600  g/l on admission to the hospital. We found that one of the ingredients in choreito, kasseki, was commonly contaminated by lead (30-50  g/g of kasseki), but this level of lead contamination in the drug had never caused poisoning previously. Our experiment indicates that another ingredient, gelatin, has lead-extracting ability and an adhesive quality on the walls of teapots. Thus, the possible causes of the toxicity seemed to be: (1) the lead in the kasseki, which was extracted by gelatin that had adhered to the wall of the pot, accumulated in large quantities for a long period of time (the patient used the same pot for more than a year without washing); and (2) a large quantity of the accumulated lead was released into the decoted drug day by day and induced the intoxication. In all, 37.2 mg of lead was extracted by 10 extractions of 4% acetic acid from the patient's pot. Repeated extraction (four times) of lead from the pot which was made by the same manufacturer in the same lot of the patient's pot with acetic acid, only totally 18.5  g of lead was detected.Also, it is evident that the intoxication was due to an improper method of decoction, that is, the patient did not prepare the tea according to Japanese pharmsacopoedia. The patient decocted all of the ingredients at the same time.

9028479|t|Effects of choreito and takushya consumption on in vitro and in vivo struvite solubility in cat urine.
9028479|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of the takushya portion of choreito, a traditional Chinese treatment for urolithiasis, on urine and struvite crystal variables in cats fed diets containing takushya. SAMPLE POPULATION: 6 male and 6 female adult cats, all considered to be clinically normal on the basis of physical examination findings, results of CBC, serum biochemical analyses, urinalyses, and urine cultures; and freedom from urolithiasis on the basis of urethrocystoscopic (females) or urethrocystographic (males) findings. PROCEDURE: Cats were fed a commercial canned diet supplemented with 0.1-mg of takushya/kg of body weight, or with 0.5 mg of choreito/kg. Diets were fed, using a Latin-square design, to 3 groups of 4 cats (2 male, 2 female) each for 2 weeks, followed by blood and 24-hour urine sample collections. RESULTS: Consumption of takushya, which comprises 20% by weight of choreito, was not associated with adverse effects in cats at the amounts provided during the period of study. Moreover, takushya was responsible for most of the effect of choreito consumption on reduction of urine pH, and approximately half its ability to reduce struvite crystal formation in cat urine. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Alternative treatments for struvite urolithiasis in cats may be feasible.

7978637|t|Effects of choreito consumption on struvite crystal growth in urine of cats.
7978637|a|The effect of a dietary supplement, choreito, on in vitro struvite crystal growth in feline urine was evaluated. Adult specific-pathogen-free cats (4 females, 4 males) considered to be clinically normal on the basis of physical examination findings and normal results of CBC, serum biochemical analyses, and urinalyses obtained before the beginning of the study were used. Before 24-hour urine sample collections were made, cats were fed a commercial canned diet with 0 or 500 mg of choreito supplement/kg of body weight for at least 2 weeks in a cross-over design with 4 cats/treatment. Filtered urine samples were analyzed for urine pH, specific gravity, osmolality, and urine electrolytes. The struvite activity product was calculated, using a statistical software program that calculates urine saturation. Urine samples were placed in wells of cell culture plates, increasing concentrations of ammonium hydroxide were added to adjacent wells to stimulate struvite crystal growth, and the plates were incubated at 37 C. Crystal growth was assessed by determination of number of crystals and supersaturation index by direct visualization, using an inverted microscope. Supplementation of the diet with choreito (at this concentration) did not change urine pH, specific gravity, osmolality, urine electrolyte composition, or calculated struvite activity product. However, supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) reduced crystal number and supersaturation index. These results indicate that direct observation of struvite crystal formation in whole urine may more accurately predict the effects of treatments to prevent or treat struvite urolithiasis than do calculations based on electrolyte concentration that do not account for the effect of urine macromolecules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

9028478|t|Effects of choreito consumption on urine variables of healthy cats fed a magnesium-supplemented commercial diet.
9028478|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of choreito consumption (500 mg/kg of body weight/d) on struvite crystal formation and signs of lower urinary tract disease (LUTD) in cats consuming a commercial canned diet with 0.5% added inorganic magnesium. SAMPLE POPULATION: 6 male and 6 female adult cats, all considered to be clinically normal on the basis of physical examination findings; results of CBC, serum biochemical analyses, urinalyses, and urine cultures; and freedom from urolithiasis on the basis of urethrocystoscopic (females) or urethrocystographic (males) findings. PROCEDURE: Diets were fed for 12 weeks, or until appearance of signs of LUTD, including dysuria, hematuria, urine pH > 7.0, and severe struvite crystalluria. Presence of at least 2 of these signs was required for removal from study. Urine specimens were examined for electrolytes, struvite crystal content, and hematuria. RESULTS: Results for urine variables were compared between groups at 4 weeks, because of reduction in cat numbers attributable to removal from study. Struvite crystal content of 24-hour urine specimens was significantly lower for cats fed the choreito-containing diet. Moreover, frequency and severity of hematuria were significantly decreased in cats fed the choreito-containing diet. Correlation between hematuria and struvite crystal content was not observed in either group. Additionally, all 6 cats fed the diet without choreito had been removed from study by day 58 because of signs of LUTD. Of the 6 cats fed the choreito-containing diet, 2 completed the 12-week study. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Choreito may be beneficial for relief of some signs of struvite-associated LUTD disease in cats.

6681501|a|The oxalate content in choreito and urocalun, both herb medicines, is minimal, and their contents of Ca, Mg, and P are also small. A rat experiment was performed to clarify their effect on oxalate excretion. They did not seem to have any adverse effect on urinary oxalate excretion. They had no diuretic effect and did not promote urinary oxalate excretion in rats. Therefore, they can be used in stone-formers for long periods.

8057532|a|Using in vitro autoradiography, we investigated the effects of Kamikihito (KKT), a traditional Chinese medicine, on the specific binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and [3H]N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl)-3,4-piperidine (TCP) in the rat brain. The Bmax but not the Kd values for [3H]QNB binding to the caudate/putamen and accumbens in aged rats were lower than those in young rats. The [3H]TCP binding was also decreased in aged rats compared with that in young rats. Long-term administration of KKT modulated the [3H]QNB binding in young but not aged rats.

7820124|t|Effects of kamikihito, a traditional Chinese medicine, on neurotransmitter receptor binding in the aged rat brain determined by in vitro autoradiography: changes in dopamine D1 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor binding.
7820124|a|Using in vitro autoradiography, we investigated the effects of Kamikihito (KKT), a traditional Chinese medicine, on specific [3H]SCH23390 binding to dopamine D1 receptors and [3H]ketanserine binding to serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the rat brain. Specific binding of both compounds was affected by aging. Long-term administration of KKT resulted in decreases in [3H]SCH23390 binding to the cortex and hippocampus in aged rats, and in decreases in [3H]ketanserine binding to the caudate/putamen in young rats. These results suggest that the changes in dopamine Di and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor binding may be involved in the central effects of KKT.

24707311|t|New Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease, Kamikihito, Reverses Amyloid-b-Induced Progression of Tau Phosphorylation and Axonal Atrophy.
24707311|a|Aims. We previously reported that kamikihito (KKT), a traditional Japanese medicine, improved memory impairment and reversed the degeneration of axons in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism underlying the effects of KKT remained unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism by which KKT reverses the progression of axonal degeneration. Methods. Primary cultured cortical neurons were treated with amyloid beta (A b ) fragment comprising amino acid residues (25-35) (10      M) in an in vitro AD model. KKT (10      g/mL) was administered to the cells before or after A b treatment. The effects of KKT on A b -induced tau phosphorylation, axonal atrophy, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity were investigated. We also performed an in vivo assay in which KKT (500   mg/kg/day) was administered to 5XFAD mice once a day for 15 days. Cerebral cortex homogenates were used to measure PP2A activity. Results. KKT improved A b -induced tau phosphorylation and axonal atrophy after they had already progressed. In addition, KKT increased PP2A activity in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions. KKT reversed the progression of A b -induced axonal degeneration. KKT reversed axonal degeneration at least in part through its role as an exogenous PP2A stimulator.

25346293|t|Comparing the Effects of Kamikihito in Japan and Kami-Guibi-Tang in Korea on Memory Enhancement: Working Towards the Development of a Global Study.
25346293|a|Traditional medicine is widely used in East Asia, and studies that demonstrate its usefulness have recently become more common. However, formulation-based studies are not globally understood because these studies are country-specific. There are many types of formulations that have been introduced to Japan and Korea from China. Establishing whether a same-origin formulation has equivalent effects in other countries is important for the development of studies that span multiple countries. The present study compared the effects of same-origin traditional medicine used in Japan and Korea in an in vivo experiment. We prepared drugs that had the same origin and the same components. The drugs are called kamikihito (KKT) in Japan and kami-guibi-tang (KGT) in Korea. KKT (500   mg extract/kg/day) and KGT (500   mg extract/kg/day) were administered to ddY mice, and object recognition and location memory tests were performed. KKT and KGT administration yielded equivalent normal memory enhancement effects. 3D-HPLC showed similar, but not identical, patterns of the detected compounds between KKT and KGT. This comparative research approach enables future global clinical studies of traditional medicine to be conducted through the use of the formulations prescribed in each country.

25788964|t|The effect of tou nong san on transplanted tumor growth in nude mice.
25788964|a|Tou Nong San (TNS) is a traditional Chinese medicinal decoction used to treat sores and carbuncles. It contains four herbal drugs and one animal medicine: Radix Astragaliseu Seu Hedysari, Angelica sinensis, Ligustici Chuanxiong, Spina Gleditsiae, and stir-baked Squama Manis. Previous studies have shown that it has anticancer effects. This report validates in vivo antitumor properties of TNS. The compounds contained in TNSE were confirmed by liquid chromatographmass spectrometer (LC-MS) analysis. The in vivo antitumor activity of TNS extract (TNSE) was tested by feeding it to athymic mice harboring a human colonic tumor subcutaneous xenograft. Toxicity was monitored by recording behavior and weight parameters. Seven compounds were detected in TNSE by LC-MS. TNSE was fed to athymic mice for 2 weeks. No adverse reactions were reported. Compared to the control group, administration of TNSE to tumor bearing mice significantly reduced both tumor weight and volume. The expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70s6k1, VEGF, and CD31 were significantly reduced, the expression levels of cleaved Caspase-9 and cleaved Caspase-3 were significantly increased in the TNSE groups compared to the control group as determined by western blot and immunohistochemistry. TNSE produced anticolonic cancer effects and the underlying mechanisms involved inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway, inhibition of angiogenesis, and promotion of apoptotic proteins.

9812783|t|Effect of "jia wei fo shou san" on erythrocyte membrane calcium, zinc concentration in pregnant rats with asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation induced by passive smoking.
9812783|a|Using experimental model of pregnant rats with asymmetrical intrauterine fetal growth retardation induced by passive smoking, the effects of natural herb "Jia Wei Fo Shou San" on erythrocyte membrane calcium, zinc concentration were observed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results showed that the mean fetal birth weight, zinc concentration of erythrocyte membrane were found to be decreased in the model group as compared with the control group (P < 0.01, P < 0.01). On the other hand, the element of calcium onto erythrocyte membrane were higher in model group than that in control group (P < 0.05). These changes were significantly mild in the treated group and were similar to those of the control group (P > 0.05). Furthermore, our findings indicated that the zinc concentration of erythrocyte membrane seems to be positively correlated with the birth weight (P < 0.01). Calcium composition of red cell membrane showed a significant negative relation to the birth weight (P > 0.05). Our results provided an experimental evidence that normal concentrations of calcium and zinc onto erythrocyte play an important part in fetal growth. One of the mechanisms of "Jia Wei Fo Shou San" in improving fetal growth may have something to do with modulation of erythrocyte calcium, zinc element, thereby protecting bio-functions of erythrocyte and promoting blood circulation.

20981317|t|Suppression of ongoing experimental arthritis by a chinese herbal formula (huo-luo-xiao-ling dan) involves changes in antigen-induced immunological and biochemical mediators of inflammation.
20981317|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the major autoimmune diseases of global prevalence. The use of the anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of RA is associated with severe adverse reactions and toxicity. This limitation has necessitated the search for novel therapeutic products. We report here a traditional Chinese medicine-based herbal formula, Huo luo xiao ling dan (HLXL), which has potent antiarthritic activity as validated in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model. HLXL (2.3   g/Kg) was fed to Lewis (RT.1(1)) rats daily by gavage beginning at the onset of arthritis and then continued through the observation period. HLXL inhibited the severity of ongoing AA. This suppression of arthritis was associated with significant alterations in the T cell proliferative and cytokine responses as well as the antibody response against the disease-related antigen, mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65). There was a reduction in the level of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-1b but enhancement of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level. In addition, there was inhibition of both the anti-Bhsp65 antibody response and the serum level of nitric oxide. Thus, HLXL is a promising CAM modality for further testing in RA patients.

15620580|t|Profound difference of metabolic pharmacokinetics between pure glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizin in licorice decoction.
15620580|a|To investigate the difference of metabolic pharmacokinetics between pure glycyrrhizin (GZ) and GZ in licorice decoction, six New Zealand White rabbits were orally given pure GZ and licorice decoction containing equivalent content of GZ in a randomized crossover design. HPLC methods were used for the quantitation of GZ and glycyrrhetic acid (GA) in serum. The results indicated that the areas under curves (AUCs) of GZ and GA after administration of licorice decoction were significantly higher than those after pure GZ. This result was contradictory with that obtained in rats. To explore the mechanism of the pharmacokinetic difference, feces of rabbits, rats, pigs and humans were used to investigate the presystemic metabolism of pure GZ and GZ in licorice decoction. The results indicated that pure GZ was hydrolyzed to GA more rapidly and to a greater extent than that in licorice decoction by various feces. In addition, when pure GZ was fermented, the metabolic profiles of GA and 3-dehydroGA in rabbit feces were quite different from other feces. In conclusion, the bioavailabilities of GZ and GA are significantly better from licorice than from pure GZ in rabbits but the presystemic metabolism of pure GZ in rabbit is rather different from that in rat, pig and human.

12575392|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effect of recombinant roasted licorice decoction (RRLD) combined with low-dose glucocorticoids (GC) in treating idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). METHODS: Forty-three patients were divided semi-randomly into the treated group (n = 21) and the control group (n = 22), the former was treated with RRLD plus low-dose GC, and the latter was treated mainly with normal dosage of GC. RESULTS: The total effective rate of the treated group was better than that of the control group, the difference between these two groups was significant (P < 0.05). After treatment the platelet count in the treated group arose from (36.29 +/- 9.70) x 10(9)/L to (95.14 +/- 18.26) x 10(9)/L, while in the control group from (37.31 +/- 9.29) x 10(9)/L to (77.73 +/- 21.96) x 10(9)/L, the RRLD was superior to nat of GC in raising platelet count, the difference between them was also significant (P < 0.01). The treated group was lower obviously than the control group in adverse reaction (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of RRLD plus low-dose GC is reliable in treating ITP, with less adverse reaction.

19209930|t|Glycyrrhizin and licorice significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate in rats.
19209930|a|Glycyrrhizin (GZ) and licorice (root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis) are worldwide food additives and important oriental phytomedicines. This study investigated the biological fate of GZ by orally giving GZ and licorice decoction (LD) to rats. The serum concentrations of GZ and glycyrrhetic acid (GA) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that GZ was not detected and GA was present in serum until 3 days postdosing of GZ and LD. To evaluate the effects of GZ and licorice on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate (MTX), an important immunosuppressant with a narrow therapeutic window, rats were orally given MTX with and without GZ and LD in different dosage regimens. The serum MTX concentration was determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The results revealed that the AUC and MRT of MTX were significantly increased by GZ and LD. In conclusion, the concurrent use of GZ or licorice with MTX should be with caution.

23983334|t|Influence of honey-roasting on the main pharmacological activities and the water-soluble active glycosides of licorice.
23983334|a|In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), licorice is usually processed with honey and traditionally used in decoction form. However, the influence of honey-roasting on the main pharmacological activities and the water-soluble active constituents of licorice has not been reported. The aim of the present study is to determine whether honey-roasting can modify the main pharmacological activities and the active constituents of licorice. According to licorice clinical application and processing method, the mainly related pharmacological activities of crude licorice, processed licorice and refined honey, such as enhancing immune function, relieving cough, eliminating phlegm and detoxication, were compared. The results showed that honey-roasting obviously reinforced the licorice activity of enhancing Pi-deficiency mice's immune function, and significantly weaken the licorice activity of relieving cough, removing phlegm and detoxication. However, honey didn't show the significant activity of relieving cough, removing phlegm and detoxication. The influence of honey-roasting on the chemical compositions in licorice slice and licorice decoction was investigated by using HPLC. The results showed that the content and the decocting quantity of mainly 5 active glycosides in licorice, i.e. liquiritin apioside, liquiritin, licuraside, isoliquiritin and glycyrrhizin, obviously changed after processing; glycyrrhizin and liquiritin obviously decomposed during honey-roasting. In conclusion, honey-roasting obviously modified the main pharmacological activities and the water-soluble compositions of licorice. The modification was not cause by honey only. This finding may shed some light on understanding the differences in the therapeutic values of crude and processed licorice.

15341554|t|A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the Chinese herbal medicine "ba wei di huang wan" in the treatment of dementia.
15341554|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, ba wei di huang wan (BDW), improves cognitive and physical functioning in dementia patients. DESIGN: An 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Long-term-care facility in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three patients with mild to severe dementia (7 men and 26 women; mean age +/- standard deviation=84.4 +/- 7.8) were recruited and enrolled from May 2002 through September 2002. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to the active drug (BDW) group (n=16) or the placebo group (n=17) and treated for 8 weeks. MEASUREMENT: Cognitive function and activities of daily living (ADLs); palsatility index. RESULTS: After the trial, cognitive function as assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) significantly improved from 13.5 +/- 8.5 to 16.3 +/- 7.7 (P<.01, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-4.1 to -1.4) in the BDW group. The ADL score in the Barthel Index also significantly changed, from 61.8 +/- 34.6 to 78.9 +/- 21.1 (P<.01, 95% CI=-26.2 to -7.9). In contrast, MMSE and Barthel Index scores of the placebo group showed no significant change. Eight weeks after the end of the administration, MMSE and Barthel Index scores of the BDW group declined to the baseline level. The pulsatility index in the internal carotid artery as measured using Doppler sonography significantly decreased in the BDW group (2.5 +/- 1.7 to 1.9 +/- 0.5, P<.05) but not in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: These results argue the benefits of BDW in the treatment of dementia.

24636045|t|Herbal drug ninjin'yoeito accelerates myelopoiesis but not erythropoiesis in vitro.
24636045|a|Some Kampo medicines that are herbal and traditional in Japan have had beneficial effects when given to patients with anemia. However, molecular mechanisms underlying their effects are unclear. To address this question, four Kampo medicines used to treat anemia-ninjin'yoeito (NYT), shimotsuto (SMT), juzentaihoto (JTT), and daibofuto (DBT)-were tested separately using in vitro cultures of mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells. Among them, NYT was most effective in stimulating cell proliferation and up-regulating Myc expression. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that, among hematopoietic components of those cultures, myeloid cells expressing CD45/Mac-1/Gr-1/F4/80 increased in number, but Ter119/CD71 erythroid cells did not. Accordingly, real-time PCR analysis showed up-regulation of the myeloid gene Pu.1, whereas the erythroid genes Gata1 and Klf1 were down-regulated. Overall, these findings provide molecular evidence that NYT accelerates myelopoiesis but not erythropoiesis in vitro.

18239447|a|We present a case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by allergic reactions to shiniseihaito. An 84-year-old woman showed acute interstitial pneumonia followed by ARDS after taking shiniseihaito for the treatment of rhinitis. The ARDS were markedly improved with corticosteroid therapy. This case was diagnosed as being induced by shiniseihaito because it was compatible with 4 of 5 of Camus's criteria. The stimulation index of the drug lymphocyte stimulation test with shiniseihaito increased after corticosteroid therapy had been tapered and suggested that the mechanism of acute interstitial pneumonia in this case was allergic reaction induced by shiniseihaito. This is the seventh reported case of drug induced lung injury by shiniseihaito. We recommend careful observation when this medicine is prescribed.

15791398|a|Steinernema robustispiculum n. sp. (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) was isolated from woodland in Chumomray National Park, Sason, Sathay, Kontum, Vietnam. Its morphology, morphometrics, cross-hybridisation and the ITS-rDNA sequence analysis revealed that S. robustispiculum clearly differs from other known Steinernema spp. As in the cases of S. intermedium (Poinar, 1985), S. robustispiculum has very robust spicules, but it can be distinguished by the longer tail of the infective juvenile, lower E%, shorter spicules, the shape of the spicules, the number of genital papillae in the caudal region and the presence of a mucron on the male tail. S. robustispiculum has a lateral field resembling that of S. sangi Phan, Nguyen _ Moens, 2001, but can be distinguished by a higher E%, higher D%, smaller length to width ratio of the spicules and the morphology of both the spicule head (manubrium) and the dorsal lobe of the spicule. The morphometrics of infective juveniles of S. robustispiculum are similar to those of S. monticolum Stock, Choo _ Kaya, 1997; these species can be distingusihed by the position of the excretory pore, the smaller length to width ratio of the spicules, and the length and morphology of the spicule head (manubrium). The phylogenetic relationships within Steinernema Travassos, 1927, including the newly sequenced Vietnamese species S. robustispiculum n. sp., S. loci Phan, Nguyen _ Moens, 2001, S. thanhi Phan, Nguyen _ Moens, 2001 and S. sangi, are presented based on analyses of the ITS-rDNA.

19460386|t|Steinernema xueshanense n. sp. (Rhabditida, Steinernematidae), a new species of entomopathogenic nematode from the province of Yunnan, southeast Tibetan Mts., China.
19460386|a|During a random EPN survey in the northern part of the Yunnan province (southeastern Tibet, Dequen district, town of Dequen) in 2005, soil samples containing an unknown EPN species were collected. The new species is described herein as Steinernema xueshannense n. sp. named after the Xue Shan Mts. a mountain range between Yunnan and Tibet where the nematode was collected. The isolate is a new species belonging to the Steinernema feltiae /kraussei group. S. xueshanense n. sp. is characterized by male, female of both generations and infective juveniles (IJ). IJ lateral field with eight ridges, submarginal pair less distinct, formula 2, 7, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, Hyaline portion occupies approximately one half of tail length. Second-generation males with distinct mucron and moderately curved spicules. Females wuth a characteristic cone on the tail. Infective juveniles of S. xueshanense n. sp. differ from S. akhursti, S. cholashanense S. kraussei, S. oregonense by different number of ridges in lateral fields. Species which have same number of eight lateral ridges, such as S. silvaticum, S. thanhi, S. weiseri differs from S. xueshanense n. sp. by less prominent sublateral pair whereas those species have all ridges equally spaced and prominent. Only S. feltiae possess the same pattern of ridges as S. xueshanense n. sp., but this species differ by shape of spicules with oblongate manubrium. The description of S. sangi gives only a few characters to compare this species with S. xueshanense n. sp. The exception is the excretory pore position of IJs which is at 40% of pharynx length whereas in other species of this group, including S. xueshanense n. sp., it is situated approximately at 50%. Cross-breedings, sequences of ITS and D2/D3 regions of the ribosomal DNA confirmed the new species identity.

26547580|t|The renoprotective effect of shichimotsukokato on hypertension-induced renal dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
26547580|a|Antihypertensive treatment is highly important to prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease. Shichimotsukokato (SKT), a traditional Japanese medicine (i.e., Kampo formula), lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) in experimental animal models of hypertension. However, its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the potential renoprotective mechanism of SKT in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Ten-week-old SHRs were randomly divided into four groups (six rats per group). In the SHR control group, the SBP increased remarkably during the 8-week experimental period. In the SHRs, SKT extract administered orally at a daily dose of 0.45 or 0.15 g/kg significantly suppressed the increase in SBP to the same extent as telmisartan administered orally at a daily dose of 0.01 g/kg. At the end of the experiment, blood, urine, and kidney cortex tissue samples were examined. The SKT treatment significantly decreased urinary albumin excretion to nearly the same level as the telmisartan treatment. A notable loss of chloride channel 5 (ClC-5), a chloride channel in the proximal renal tubules, occurred in the SHR control group. Thus, we concluded that SKT administration significantly ameliorated this decrease. The mechanism of SKT in reducing urinary albumin excretion is mediated, at least partly, by prevention of the loss of ClC-5 in the renal cortex of SHRs.

23417504|a|Nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial vasodilator produced by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous NOS inhibitor and mainly catabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). As we reported, the antihypertensive effect of shichimotsukokato (SKT), a formula of Japanese traditional kampo medicine consisting of 7 crude drugs, in 5/6 nephrectomized rats, is mediated by the DDAH-ADMA-NO pathway. Our present study aimed to explore the effective compounds of SKT using Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) II cells. We isolated two isoflavones, calycosin and formononetin from astragalus root, one of the components of SKT, which can promote DDAH2 protein and mRNA expressions in MDCK II cells. The neuronal NOS levels were also upregulated by the treatment of calycosin and formononetin. These results suggest that calycosin and formononetin could be the active ingredients of astragalus root and SKT that cause antihypertensive effects. The increased levels of DDAH2 and NOS may enhance NO production, decrease ADMA level and improve endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunction.

16204938|t|Preventive effect of chotosan, a Kampo medicine, on transient ischemia-induced learning deficit is mediated by stimulation of muscarinic M1 but not nicotinic receptor.
16204938|a|We have previously shown using a water maze task that transient 2 vessel occlusion (T2VO) induced learning deficit in mice and that the deficit was prevented by pre-treatment of mice with chotosan, a Kampo prescription. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the preventive effect of chotosan on T2VO-induced learning deficit. Chotosan administration 1 h before T2VO operation prevented learning impairment. The extract of Uncaria, a major constituent of chotosan, also had a protective effect on learning impairment in T2VO mice, whereas Uncaria-free chotosan had no beneficial effect on maze performance of T2VO mice. The ameliorative effect of chotosan was blocked by pirenzepine, a muscarinic M1 antagonist, but not by mecamylamine, a nicotinic receptor antagonist. Acetylcholine (ACh) content in the hippocampus of T2VO mice was significantly lower than that in the hippocampus of sham-operated control mice. Chotosan and Uncaria administration attenuated T2VO-induced reduction of ACh levels in the brain. These results suggest that the preventive effect of chotosan on transient ischemia-induced learning impairment is mainly attributable to the effect of Uncaria and that the ameliorative effect is mediated by stimulation of muscarinic M1 receptor.

23883485|t|Kampo formulations, chotosan, and yokukansan, for dementia therapy: existing clinical and preclinical evidence.
23883485|a|Cognitive deficits and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are typical features of patients with dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and other forms of senile dementia. Clinical evidence has demonstrated the potential usefulness of chotosan (CTS) and yokukansan (YKS), traditional herbal formulations called Kampo medicines, in the treatment of cognitive disturbance and BPSD in dementia patients, although the indications targeted by CTS and YKS in Kampo medicine differ. The availability of CTS and YKS for treating dementia patients is supported by preclinical studies using animal models of dementia that include cognitive/emotional deficits caused by aging and diabetes, dementia risk factors. These studies have led not only to the concept of a neuronal basis for the CTS- and YKS-induced amelioration of cognitive function and emotional/psychiatric symptom-related behavior in animal models, but also to a proposal that ingredient(s) of Uncariae Uncis cum Ramulus, a medicinal herb included in CTS and YKS, may play an important role in the actions of these formulae in dementia patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the active ingredients of these formulae and their target endogenous molecules implicated in the anti-dementia drug-like actions.

25459756|t|Chemical profiling with HPLC-FTMS of exogenous and endogenous chemicals susceptible to the administration of chotosan in an animal model of type 2 diabetes-induced dementia.
25459756|a|In our previous study, the daily administration of chotosan (CTS), a Kampo formula consisting of Uncaria and other 10 different crude drugs, ameliorated cognitive deficits in several animal models of dementia including type 2 diabetic db/db mice in a similar manner to tacrine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The present study investigated the metabonomics of CTS in db/db mice, a type 2 diabetes model, and m/m mice, a non-diabetes control strain, to identify the exogenous and endogenous chemicals susceptible to the administration of CTS using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with an orbitrap hybrid Fourier transform mass spectrometer. The results obtained revealed that the systemic administration of CTS for 20 days led to the distribution of Uncalia plant-derived alkaloids such as rhynchophylline, hirsuteine, and corynoxeine in the plasma and brains of db/db and m/m mice and induced alterations in four major metabolic pathways; i.e., (1) purine, (2) tryptophan, (3) cysteine and methionine, (4) glycerophospholipids in db/db mice. Moreover, glycerophosphocholine (GPC) levels in the plasma and brain were significantly higher in CTS-treated db/db mice than in vehicle-treated control animals. The results of the in vitro experiment using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures demonstrated that GPC (10-30 M), as well as tacrine, protected hippocampal cells from N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity in a manner that was reversible with the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine, whereas GPC had no effect on the activity of acetylcholinesterase in vitro. Our results demonstrated that some CTS constituents with neuropharmacological activity were distributed in the plasma and brain tissue following the systemic administration of CTS and may subsequently have affected some metabolic pathways including glycerophospholipid metabolism and cognitive function in db/db mice. Moreover, the present metabonomic analysis suggested that GPC is a putative endogenous chemical that may be involved in the tacrine-like actions of CTS in the present diabetic animal model.

18057707|t|Chotosan enhances macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA expression in the ischemic rat brain and C6Bu-1 glioma cells.
18057707|a|Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a cytokine which has been recently reported to have a neuroprotective effect on ischemic rat brain. In this study, we investigated the effect of chotosan, an oriental medicine, which has been clinically demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of vascular dementia, on M-CSF gene expression in rats with permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (P2VO) in vivo and in a C6Bu-1 glioma cell line in vitro. The expression level of M-CSF mRNA in the cerebral cortices of P2VO rats was significantly higher than that in the cerebral cortices of sham-operated animals. Repeated treatment of P2VO rats with chotosan (75 mg/kg per day) for 4 d after P2VO significantly increased the expression level of M-CSF mRNA in the cortex but it had no effect on the expression of beta-actin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNAs. Moreover, the present in vitro studies revealed that chotosan treatment (10-100 mug/ml) of C6Bu-1 glioma cells dose-dependently enhanced M-CSF mRNA expression without affecting the expression of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNAs. The effect of chotosan was reversed by Ro 31-8220 (1 muM), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, but not by H-89 (10 muM), a selective protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. These findings suggest that the upregulatory effect of chotosan on M-CSF mRNA expression involves PKC and may play an important role in the anti-vascular dementia action of this formula.

18776713|t|Goshuyuto, a traditional Japanese medicine for migraine, inhibits platelet aggregation in guinea-pig whole blood.
18776713|a|The effects of goshuyuto and chotosan, traditional Japanese medicines, on collagen-induced platelet aggregation were examined using guinea-pig blood. Goshuyuto at the concentration of 1,000 mug/mL inhibited collagen-induced platelet hyper-aggregation to the same degree as aspirin at the concentration of 100 mumol/L, but chotosan did not. Goshuyuto is composed of four medicinal herbs. Of them, aqueous extracts of Evodiae Fructus and Zingiberis Rhizoma inhibited platelet aggregation, but aqueous extracts of Zizyphi Fructus and Ginseng Radix did not. Two components of Zingiberis Rhizoma, 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol, also inhibited platelet aggregation. These results suggest that Evodiae Fructus and Zingiberis Rhizoma may play important roles in the anti-aggregation effects of goshuyuto and that 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol are among the active ingredients. Therefore, goshuyuto may ameliorate migraine by preventing the hyper-aggregation of platelets in migraine with aura.

26994819|t|Chotosan improves Ab1-42-induced cognitive impairment and neuroinflammatory and apoptotic responses through the inhibition of TLR-4/NF-kB signaling in mice.
26994819|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Recently, the focus on neuroinflammation is intensified as its complex pathophysiological role has emerged in multiple central nervous system(CNS) disorders. Chotosan (CTS), known as a traditional herbal formula, is often utilized to treat relevant nervous system diseases in China. It was demonstrated effectively to alleviate cognitive deficit associated with aging, diabetes, hypoperfusion and cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of CTS on Ab1-42-induced cognitive dysfunction remain unclear. Here, we further investigated the effects of chotosan on memory performance, neuroinflammation and apoptotic responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The learning and memory ability is evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) task and Y-maze test following intrahippocampal infusion of aggregated Ab1-42. The expression level of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), NF-kB p65, Bcl-2 and Bax was examined by Western blot. TLR-4 level is also assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to determine the generation of inflammatory mediators. The caspase-3 activity is analysed by commercial kits. RESULTS: The repeated treatment with CTS (750mg/kg or 375mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks significantly restored Ab1-42-induced memory impairment in mice. Meanwhile, this treatment also remarkably reduced TLR-4 and NF-kB p65 expression accompanying with the diminished release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-a and IL-1b in hippocampus. The neuronal apoptosis is also inhibited as evidenced by increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decrease in pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3 activity compared to that of the model mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that chotosan can ameliorate Ab1-42-induced memory dysfunction via inhibiting neuroinflammation and apoptosis at least partialy mediated by TLR-4/NF-kB signaling pathway.

24476927|t|Chotosan, a Kampo formula, ameliorates hippocampal LTD and cognitive deficits in juvenile-onset diabetes rats.
24476927|a|Childhood-onset type 1 diabetes is associated with modest impairments in cognition and has an elevated risk of cognitive decline. Our previous study showed that working memory and hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) were impaired in juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus (JDM) rats. In this study, we investigated the effect of chotosan (CTS), a traditional herbal formula called a Kampo medicine, which has been clinically demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of vascular dementia, on JDM rats. The repeated treatment with CTS (1 g/kg per day) for 3 - 7 days restored spatial working memory and hippocampal LTD in JDM rats. The expression level of NR2B glutamate receptor subunits, but not other glutamate receptor subunits was enhanced in the hippocampus of JDM rats, and repeated treatment with CTS reversed these changes. These results suggest that CTS improves diabetes-induced cognitive deficits by modulating NMDA-receptor subunit expression.

15988744|t|HPLC separation of hesperidin and the C-2 epimer in commercial hesperidin samples and herbal medicines.
15988744|a|Hesperidin (2S-form), the flavanone 7-O-glycoside, is the main constituent of some Citrus species. The peels of two Citrus species are used as a crude drug, Aurantii nobilis pericarpium, in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia and as components in Kampo formulae. Thus, HPLC analysis of hesperidin as a marker compound is needed for quality control of medicines. Hesperidin was separated from the corresponding C-2 epimer by normal-phase HPLC using a chiral column. Moreover, narirutin and neohesperidin were also separated from the corresponding C-2 epimer. The analyses of commercial hesperidin samples revealed that they contained the C-2 epimer and that the relative ratio of hesperidin to the epimer ranged from 92:8 to 59:41. The HPLC application to Citrus extracts suggested that naturally occurring hesperidin in Citrus has the 2S configuration; however, the dry extracts of rikkunshito and chotosan, which are Kampo formulations containing Aurantii nobilis pericarpium, were found to contain a considerable amount of the (2R)-epimer. These data suggest that the decoction process of the formulae partly converts hesperidin to the epimer. Because diastereomers differ from each other in physicochemical and biological activities, HPLC to separate hesperidin from the C-2 epimer should be introduced into the letter of approval for herbal medicines.

23082896|t|Chotosan ameliorates cognitive and emotional deficits in an animal model of type 2 diabetes: possible involvement of cholinergic and VEGF/PDGF mechanisms in the brain.
23082896|a|BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the risk factors for cognitive deficits such as Alzheimer's disease. To obtain a better understanding of the anti-dementia effect of chotosan (CTS), a Kampo formula, we investigated its effects on cognitive and emotional deficits of type 2 diabetic db/db mice and putative mechanism(s) underlying the effects. METHODS: Seven-week-old db/db mice received daily administration of CTS (375 - 750 mg/kg, p.o.) and the reference drug tacrine (THA: 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) during an experimental period of 7 weeks. From the age of 9-week-old, the animals underwent the novel object recognition test, the modified Y-maze test, and the water maze test to elucidate cognitive performance and the elevated plus maze test to elucidate anxiety-related behavior. After completing behavioral studies, Western blotting and immunohistochemical studies were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with age-matched non-diabetic control strain (m/m) mice, db/db mice exhibited impaired cognitive performance and an increased level of anxiety. CTS ameliorated cognitive and emotional deficits of db/db mice, whereas THA improved only cognitive performance. The phosphorylated levels of Akt and PKCa in the hippocampus were significantly lower and higher, respectively, in db/db mice than in m/m mice. Expression levels of the hippocampal cholinergic marker proteins and the number of the septal cholinergic neurons were also reduced in db/db mice compared with those in m/m mice. Moreover, the db/db mice had significantly reduced levels of vasculogenesis/angiogenesis factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor type 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B, and PDGF receptor b, in the hippocampus. CTS and THA treatment reversed these neurochemical and histological alterations caused by diabetes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CTS ameliorates diabetes-induced cognitive deficits by protecting central cholinergic and VEGF/PDGF systems via Akt signaling pathway and that CTS exhibits the anxiolytic effect via neuronal mechanism(s) independent of cholinergic or VEGF/PDGF systems in db/db mice.

8328425|a|The inhibitory effect of Orengedokuto on lipid peroxide and sialidase was investigated using rats affected with carrageenin cotton pellet-induced granuloma and adjuvant arthritis. As a result, in the case of rats with carrageenin cotton pellet-induced granuloma, a significant inhibitory effect on granuloma formation was observed in the Orengedokuto treated rats (150 mg/kg/day) which showed a decrease in serum lipid peroxide (p < 0.001) and an increase in acid soluble glycoprotein (p < 0.001). In the case of adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, however, the condition of the arthritis was not improved at all, and was even aggravated in spite of the decrease in serum lipid peroxide.

17329845|t|An herbal medicine orengedokuto prevents indomethacin-induced enteropathy.
17329845|a|Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a key regulator of gastrointestinal, immunological, and mucosal homeostasis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the prostaglandin-producing enzyme cyclooxygenases (COXs), and can induce serious complications, such as gastrointestinal damage, with long-term treatment. Orengedokuto (OGT), a Japanese traditional herbal medicine (Kampo medicine), is effective in various animal models of enteropathy. In the present study we examined whether OGT prevents enteropathy induced by NSAIDs in mice. Ulceration in the small intestine was induced with 2 subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (20 mg/kg body weight). Orally administered OGT prevented or reduced lethality, intestinal lesions, bleeding, increased serum nitrate/nitrite levels, and reduction of mucosal PGE2 induced by indomethacin. These beneficial effects of OGT were accompanied by increased production of PGE2 and interleukin 10 by isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells; COX-2 in these cells may be a major source of PGE2 in normal intestines. These findings suggest that OGT could be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and adverse reactions to NSAIDs.

18296738|a|Data on the efficacy of herbal compounds are often burdened by the lack of appropriate controls or a limited statistical power. Treatments to prevent the progression of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to steatohepatitis (NASH) remain unsatisfactory. A total of 56 rabbits were arrayed into 7 groups fed with standard rabbit chow (SRC), SRC with 1% cholesterol, or each of the five experimental treatments (Kampo formulas 1% keishibukuryogan [KBG], 1% orengedokuto [OGT], and 1% shosaikoto [SST]; vitamin E [VE]; or pioglitazone [PG]) in a 1% cholesterol SRC. We analyzed changes after 12 weeks in plasma and liver lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, adipocytokines, oxidative stress, and liver fibrosis. Data demonstrated that all five treatments were associated with significant amelioration of lipid profiles, oxidative stress, and liver fibrosis compared to no supplementation. KBG was superior to VE and PG in the reduction of liver total cholesterol (P < 0.01) and lipid peroxidase levels (P < 0.05), urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (P < 0.05), hepatic alpha-smooth muscle actin positive areas (P < 0.01) and activated stellate cells (P < 0.01). In conclusion, there was a statistically significant benefit of Kampo formulas (KBG in particular) on a dietary model of NAFLD/NASH. Future studies need to be directed at the mechanisms in the treatment of NASH.

24390259|a|BACKGROUND: Mesenteric phlebosclerosis (MP) is a relatively rare disease of the colon. An association between MP and Chinese herbal medicine intake has recently been recognized. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the association between MP and Chinese herbal medicine intake in 42 patients, including those reported in the literature as well as those treated by us. RESULTS: Approximately 90% patients treated by us reported a history of Chinese herbal medicine intake, particularly kamishoyosan, orengedokuto, and sanshishi (gardeniae fructus), the lattermost being consumed by the majority of patients as a crude herbal medicine. DISCUSSION: Several MP patients report a history of Chinese herbal medicine intake. Furthermore, symptoms are exacerbated in MP patients who continue to consume the medicine after onset. Interestingly, MP was reported to develop in a married couple who had consumed the same Chinese herbal medicine for a prolonged period. These findings suggest that the intake of Chinese herbal medicine, particularly sanshishi, is strongly associated with MP development.

11218729|a|This study was carried out to investigate the effects of Sho-saiko-to (Xiao Chai Hu Tang), a Chinese traditional medicine, on the gastric function including the gastric emptying rate (GER) and intragastric pH in rats. Additionally, the effects of the GER and intragastric pH on tolbutamide absorption after oral administration were examined. The GER measured at 40 min after dosing was reduced to about 70% by the pretreatment of Sho-saiko-to (500 mg/kg). The plasma tolbutamide concentration in the rats treated with a 250 mg/kg dose of Sho-saiko-to was significantly lower than that in the control group. Plasma tolbutamide concentrations increased along with the GER in the group co-administered Sho-saiko-to, and there were significant correlations between the GERs and plasma levels in both time points at 20 and 40 min after administration. In the study using pylorus-ligated rats, Sho-saiko-to significantly elevated the intragastric pH, but induced no change in the concentrations of tolbutamide dissolved in the gastric content. Additionally, Sho-saiko-to did not change the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of tolbutamide up to 60 min after administration into the stomach loop, and gastric absorption has been considered to minimally contribute to whole absorption of tolbutamide in the gastrointestinal tract. These results indicate that Sho-saiko-to has an inhibitory effect on the function of gastric emptying in rats. The reduced gastric emptying could affect gastrointestinal absorption, resulting in the lower plasma concentration of tolbutamide after oral administration. Furthermore, it is suggested that Sho-saiko-to can raise the intragastric pH but affect neither the intragastric dissolution nor the gastric absorption of tolbutamide.

16644487|t|Xiao chai hu tang inhibits CVB1 virus infection of CCFS-1 cells through the induction of Type I interferon expression.
16644487|a|Coxsackie B virus type 1 (CVB1) infection is known to cause high morbidity and mortality in children, however, there is no effective drug for treating this disease. The present study aimed to examine the antiviral activity of xiao chai hu tang (XCHT), a popular herbal drug for treating viral and bacterial infections, against CVB1 infection and its mechanisms of action. Our data showed that XCHT neutralized the CVB1-induced cytopathic effect in human neonatal foreskin fibroblast cell line (CCFS-1/KMC), with IC50 (virus-induced cytopathic effect by 50%) and EC50 (concentration of 50% effectiveness) values around 12.39 and 50.93 microg/ml, respectively. Its CC50 (concentration of 50% cellular cytotoxicity) and SI (selective index) values were 945.75 microg/ml and 18.92, respectively. These results suggest that XCHT possessed anti-CVB1 activity, and showed no effect on CCFS-1 cell viability and growth at concentration 250 microg/ml. The time-of-addition studies showed that XCHT (50, 100 and 200 microg/ml) added at various time of preinfection (-1 to -3 h), coinfection (0 h) and postinfection (1 approximately 3 h) could inhibit CVB1 infection. Interestingly, XCHT also showed an inhibition on viral replication through the induction of IFN-alpha/beta expression. In conclusion, XCHT possessed antiviral activity against CVB1 infection. It interfered the early stage of viral replication (prophylactic effect) and viral replication after infection (therapeutic effect) through the induction of Type I interferon expression.

17875029|t|Clinical effectiveness of the Kampo medicine kamishoyosan for adjunctive treatment of tardive dyskinesia in patients with schizophrenia: a 16-week open trial.
17875029|a|The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of kamishoyosan for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia, and to investigate the relationship between tardive dyskinesia and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Sixty-nine schizophrenia patients were enrolled; of these, 49 presented with tardive dyskinesia while the remaining 20 patients showed no tardive dyskinesia. The tardive dyskinesia group was treated for 16 weeks with kamishoyosan and assessed using the abnormal involuntary movement scale. The abnormal involuntary movement scale scores in the tardive dyskinesia group were evaluated at baseline and after 4, 8, and 16 weeks of treatment. The BDNF levels of all subjects were measured at baseline in order to compare differences in serum BDNF levels between the tardive dyskinesia group and the non-tardive dyskinesia group, and to correlate the severity of tardive dyskinesia and serum BDNF in the tardive dyskinesia group. A meaningful reduction in total abnormal involuntary movement scale scores was observed in the tardive dyskinesia group treated with kamishoyosan at 4, 8, and 16 weeks of treatment (P < 0.01). No significant differences in serum BDNF levels were detected between the tardive dyskinesia group and the non-tardive dyskinesia group at baseline. Furthermore, no significant correlation was seen between the severity of tardive dyskinesia and serum BDNF levels. The present study suggests that kamishoyosan might be a promising adjunctive treatment for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia.

20647958|t|Effects of Japanese traditional medicines on circulating cytokine levels in women with hot flashes.
20647958|a|OBJECTIVE: The effects of the Japanese traditional medicines keishibukuryogan and kamishoyosan on circulating cytokines were examined to clarify the difference in the actions of Japanese traditional medicines in women with hot flashes. METHODS: Seven premenopausal, 51 perimenopausal, 45 spontaneously postmenopausal and 17 surgically postmenopausal women who had complained of hot flashes were enrolled in this study. Eighty women who hoped to receive Japanese traditional medicines were randomly assigned in open, parallel-group fashion to a keishibukuryogan group or kamishoyosan group. Forty women who did not want any treatment for hot flashes were followed up for 6 months as a control group. Serum levels of cytokines were measured using a multiplexed human cytokine assay. RESULTS: The proportions of responders in women treated with keishibukuryogan and kamishoyosan were 73.7% and 69.2%, respectively. Serum monocyte chemotactic protein-1 level in women treated with keishibukuryogan decreased significantly (P = 0.0037). On the other hand, concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1b in women treated with kamishoyosan decreased significantly (P = 0.019 and P = 0.039, respectively). In both keishibukuryogan and kamishoyosan responder groups, serum IL-8 concentrations were reduced significantly (P = 0.021 and P = 0.014, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments with keishibukuryogan and kamishoyosan reduce the circulating IL-8 level, which is involved in thermoregulation in perimenopausal women with hot flashes. In addition, keishibukuryogan decreases circulating monocyte chemotactic protein-1 level in postmenopausal women.

19179025|t|Changes in circulating cytokine levels in midlife women with psychological symptoms with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and Japanese traditional medicine.
19179025|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to compare the effects on serum cytokine concentrations of paroxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and kamishoyosan, a Japanese traditional medicine, in midlife women with psychological symptoms. METHODS: Seventy-six women with psychological symptoms such as anxiety and mild depression as menopausal symptoms were enrolled in this study. Thirty-eight women received oral administration of 10mg paroxetine every day, and 38 women received oral administration of kamshoyosan every day for 6 months. Overall climacteric symptoms were assessed using Greene's climacteric scale. Serum levels of cytokines were measured using a multiplexed human cytokine assay. RESULTS: Greene's total scores in both women treated with paroxetine and in women treated with kamishoyosan decreased significantly. Percentage decreases in Greene's total, psychological and vasomotor scores during the 6-month period in the paroxetine group were significantly greater than those in the kamishoyosan group. Serum IL-6 concentration in women treated with paroxetine decreased significantly. Serum concentrations of IL-8, IL-10, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in women treated with paroxetine decreased significantly. On the other hand, serum IL-6 concentration in women treated with kamishoyosan decreased significantly, but other serum concentrations did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Decrease in IL-6 concentration may be involved in the mechanism of the actions of both paroxetine and kamishoyosan in women with psychological symptoms, and IL-6 may therefore be useful as a marker of treatment. The action of paroxetine may also be associated with decreases in IL-8, IL-10, MIP-1beta.

24844765|t|Improvement of symptoms of aging in males by a preparation LEOPIN ROYAL containing aged garlic extract and other five of natural medicines - comparison with traditional herbal medicines (Kampo).
24844765|a|"LEOPIN ROYAL  " (LER), a non-prescription health-promoting medication in Japan, is a preparation containing six natural medicines, namely, aged garlic extract, ginseng, oriental bezoar, velvet antler, cuscuta seed and epimedium herb. To determine the effect of LER on symptoms of aging in males, we conducted an open-labeled, randomized clinical trial using Kampo (mainly kamishoyosan) as a control. Forty-nine male patients (age, 62.7 (SD 11.8) years) with mild or more pronounced symptoms of aging were enrolled and randomly assigned to the LER (n   =   24) or Kampo group (n   =   25) for 6 months. The Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale and the International Index of Erectile Function with 5 questions (IIEF-5) were tested at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of administration of the medications. In the AMS scale, the somatic and psychological sub-scores and total score decreased depending on the time course in both groups. However, the decrease in the slope of the LER group was greater than that of the Kampo group. There was a significant difference between the groups and the group and month interaction (G       M), as revealed by a linear mixed model analysis (p   <   0.05). The IIEF-5 score increased in the LER group (p   =   0.02 with regard to G       M). In conclusion, the present results indicate that LER is possibly superior to mainly kamishoyosan on the rate of improvement of symptoms of aging, including erectile dysfunction, in males.

Socially isolated OVX rats showed the longest freezing time among the following four groups: group-housed sham-operated (Sham), isolated Sham, group-housed OVX, and isolated OVX rats. Repeated oral administration of KSS (30-300  mg/kg) reduced conditioned fear-induced freezing in socially isolated OVX rats. The reduction of freezing by KSS was reversed by flumazenil (3  mg/kg) and bicuculline (3  mg/kg). These findings suggest that the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex is involved in the anxiolytic effect of KSS in socially isolated OVX rats.

25792985|t|Daisaikoto for menstrual pain: a lesson from a case with menstrual pain successfully treated with daisaikoto.
25792985|a|Menstrual pain is one of the common symptoms among women. It is estimated that 5-14% of women are sometimes absent from school or work because of pain. Usually gynecologists prescribe analgesics and/or low-dose oral contraceptives. However, such treatment is not always effective and sometimes causes an adverse effect, such as stomach pain or low body temperature. Kampo medicine is one of the choices for the menstrual pain in Japan. Tokishakuyakusan, kamishoyosan, or keishibukuryogan is commonly used for the treatment of menstrual pain. Here we report a case of menstrual pain successfully treated with daisaikoto which is not commonly used for such a case. Twenty-five-year-old woman suffered from severe menstrual pain and stress at company. She also had constipation and abdominal distension. We prescribed daisaikoto extract 7.5   g per day. Not only menstrual pain but also constipation and abdominal distension improved within 6 months. Here we propose that daisaikoto is one of the choices for the treatment of menstrual pain with mental stress.

2598363|t|[Effect of chang chun dan on noradrenaline levels of the brain and plasma in aged rats].
2598363|a|In this paper, the rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Young (Y); (2) Aged (A); (3) Aged rats treated with Chang Chun Dan (AT) for 3 months. The level of noradrenaline (NA) in brain and plasma of three group rats had been examined by radioenzymatic assay. The changes of fluorescent intensity of NA in locus coeruleus had been observed by histochemical method. The levels of NA in hypothalamus of three groups were 162 +/- 9.93, 209 +/- 13.2, 167 +/- 11.8 ng/g wet tissues and in plasma were 1.29 +/- 0.16, 0.84 +/- 0.08, 0.96 +/- 0.08 ng/ml respectively. The results showed that the NA level of hypothalamus in AT group was lower than that of A group (P less than 0.05), and the NA level in Y group was raised markedly comparing with A group (P less than 0.01). The plasma NA level in A group was significantly lower than that in Y group (P less than 0.05). The NA level in AT group was raised a little comparing with A group. But the fluorescent intensity of NA in locus coeruleus between AT and A group was no difference. The results suggested that the changes of neurotransmitter induced by Chang Chun Dan may be basis of delaying aging effect and improving symptom of Kidney deficiency induced by aging.

1453504|t|Effect of "re du qing" on the activation, proliferation and membrane fluidity of lymphocytes.
1453504|a|Effects of Chinese Medicinal Preparation "Re Du Qing" (RDQ) on the activation, proliferation and membrane fluidity of T lymphocytes from human peripheral blood were studied by means of 3H-TdR incorporation and DPH fluorescence polarization. The results showed that "RDQ" can: 1) significantly inhibit the activation of T lymphocytes; 2) restrain the proliferation of activated T lymphoblasts in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2); and 3) increase the membrane fluidity of T lymphocytes and antagonize the decreased fluidity of lymphocyte membrane mediated by Con A or PHA. The functional abnormalities of T lymphocytes in some autoimmune diseases such as arthritis and the usefulness of RDQ in the treatment of these diseases were also discussed.

1498544|a|In this study, the generalized Shwartzman reaction of rabbit induced by endotoxin of Escherichia Coli was built as DIC models. The experiment showed that the levels of lipid peroxide (LPO) in the hepatocytic microsomes of model group were increased significantly, whereas the cytochrome P-450 (Cyto. P-450) contents and aniline hydroxylase activities were obviously decreased. In the Re Du Qing (RDQ) group and dexamethasone group the decrease of LPO in hepatocytic microsomes as well as the reduction of Cyto. P-450 contents and aniline hydroxylase activities were alleviated. Furthermore, the correlation analysis indicated a significant negative correlation between levels of LPO in microsomes and the Cyto. P-450 contents as well as aniline hydroxylase activities. This study indicates the LPO may play an important role in the damage of hepatocytic microsomes and RDQ could prevent hepatocytic microsomes from injury of rabbits with endotoxin-induced DIC.

2791162|a|A rabbit endotoxic DIC model was preliminarily performed. The structures of lysosomes and mitochondria in liver cells were evidently destroyed as observed under electronic microscope, whereas those rabbits pretreated with Re Du Qing (RDQ, formerly named anti-inflammatory No. 6)--a mixture of Chinese traditional herbs providing antipyretic and detoxifying action, showed principally normal ultrastructure in liver cells. In lysosomal functional studies, the activity of the lysosomal marker enzyme--acid phosphate (ACP) was 79.0 +/- 4.7% (M +/- SD) in model group, higher than pretreated group (54.01 +/- 4.0%, P less than 0.01). Studies on the mitochondrial function showed that the significant criteria of the respiratory activity of mitochondria--respiratory control ratios (RCR) was 2.83 +/- 1.08 in model group and markedly lower than pretreated group (5.46 +/- 1.25, P less than 0.01). Mitochondrial ATPase activity (mu mol pi/min/mg pr.) was lower in model group (0.280 +/- 0.015) than in pretreated group (0.341 +/- 0.018, P less than 0.05). Lipid peroxide (LPO) in liver homogenates and serum were 1.86 +/- 0.43 n mol MDA/mg pr. and 12.26 +/- 0.84 n mol MDA/ml respectively in model group, whereas in pretreated group they gave a much lower value (1.19 +/- 0.12 and 6.55 +/- 2.97) respectively. Those data showed very significant difference between two groups (P less than 0.01). All of the above indices of pretreated group yielded values close to those of normal control group. The results of experimental study in vitro were identical to those of experimental study in vivo. These experimental studies suggested that RDQ provide antagonistic effect on endotoxin induced damage of lysosomes and mitochondria.

2060052|a|In this study, the general Shwartzman reaction of rabbits induced by Escherichia Coli endotoxin was made as DIC models. The experiments showed that the levels of lipid peroxide (LPO) in hepatic tissue and mitochondria in the model group were increased significantly compared with the control group (P less than 0.01), while superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in hepatic tissue and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in hepatic tissue and mitochondria were decreased significantly (P less than 0.01). The levels of LPO in hepatic tissue and mitochondria in Re Du Qing (RDQ) group and vitamin E (VE) group were decreased significantly (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05 respectively) compared with the model group. The levels of LPO in the RDQ group did not differ from the control group (P greater than 0.05), but the levels of LPO in the VE group were still higher than those in the control group significantly (P less than 0.05). The SOD activity in hepatic tissue and GSH-Px activity in hepatic tissue and mitochondria in both RDQ group and VE group were also significantly higher than those in the model group (P less than 0.01). These data suggest that the levels of oxygen free radicals were increased in hepatocytes and mitochondria. This is related to the decreased activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the course of pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced DIC. This study indicates that lipid peroxidation might be one of the important mechanisms resulting in hepatocellular and mitochondria from oxidative damage.

18242756|t|Keishibukuryogan ameliorates glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats.
18242756|a|Keishibukuryogan, one of the traditional herbal formulations, is used clinically to improve blood circulation. In this study, we examined the effects of keishibukuryogan on glucose and lipids metabolism in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, an animal model of type 2 diabetes. Forty-five-week-old male OLETF rats were divided into three groups: diabetic control rats given a standard chow; diabetic rats given keishibukuryogan (3%, w/w in chow); diabetic rats given pioglitazone (0.01%, w/w in chow). Oral administration of keishibukuryogan produced significant improvement against impaired glucose tolerance. On the other hand, fasting serum glucose and insulin levels, and the homeostasis index of insulin resistance did not change by keishibukuryogan treatment. Against lipid parameters, keishibukuryogan significantly lowered serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and the hepatic total cholesterol level. Keishibukuryogan treatment also significantly reduced the serum leptin level, but it had no effect on the serum adiponectin level. Additionally, keishibukuryogan showed significant effects on epididymal adipose tissue by decreasing the size of fat cells and on skeletal muscle by reducing TNF-alpha protein content. From these results, it was suggested that keishibukuryogan exerts beneficial effects on the features associated with type 2 diabetes.

19633031|t|Keishibukuryogan reduces renal injury in the early stage of renal failure in the remnant kidney model.
19633031|a|The effects of keishibukuryogan on the early stage of progressive renal failure were examined in rats subjected to 5/6 nephrectomy. Keishibukuryogan, one of the traditional herbal formulations, was given orally at a dose of 1% (w/w) and 3% (w/w) in chow. Administration of keishibukuryogan was started at 1 week after 5/6 nephrectomy and was continued for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiment, Azan staining did not reveal any severe histological changes in the kidneys of the nephrectomized rats. On the other hand, significant increases in mRNA expressions of transforming growth factor-b(1) and fibronectin related to tissue fibrosis, as examined by Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction, were observed in nephrectomized rats, and they were significantly suppressed by 3% keishibukuryogan treatment. Against gene expressions related to macrophage infiltration, 3% keishibukuryogan treatment significantly suppressed osteopontin mRNA levels, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNA levels showed a tendency to decrease, but without statistical significance. It was also observed that 3% keishibukuryogan attenuated serum urea nitrogen and urinary protein excretion levels. From these results, it was suggested that keishibukuryogan exerts beneficial effects that result in slowing the progression of chronic renal failure.

17541151|t|Effects of keishibukuryogan on vascular function in adjuvant-induced arthritis rats.
17541151|a|It is known that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) accelerates atherosclerosis. Further, the soluble form of vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is known as a predictive marker of atherosclerosis in RA patients. We reported that keishibukuryogan, one of the Kampo formulas, improved articular symptoms and decreased soluble VCAM-1 in patients with RA. In adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rats, an animal model of RA, it is known that endothelial function is injured by inflammation. So, we investigated the effect of keishibukuryogan on endothelial function in AIA rats. Lewis rats were divided into control, AIA control, and AIA with keishibukuryogan groups. The AIA with keishibukuryogan group was fed 3% keishibukuryogan contained in normal chow. On day 25 after injection of Mycobacterium butyricum, endothelium-dependent relaxation by acetylcholine in the AIA control group was suppressed, but it was improved in the AIA with keishibukuryogan group. The contractions by xanthine/xanthine oxidase in both AIA rats increased, but that in keishibukuryogan decreased compared to the AIA control group. Plasma levels of lipid peroxide increased in the AIA control group, but keishibukuryogan decreased these levels. Plasma levels of nitric oxide (NO) increased in both AIA groups. The expressions of endothelial NO synthase, inducible NO synthase and VCAM-1 of thoracic aorta were investigated by western blotting. These expressions increased in the AIA control group, but were restricted in the AIA with keishibukuryogan group. We considered that keishibukuryogan protected the endothelial function of AIA rats mainly by its anti-oxidative effect.

25793003|t|Effect of keishibukuryogan on genetic and dietary obesity models.
25793003|a|Obesity has been recognized as one of the most important risk factors for a variety of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension/cardiovascular diseases, steatosis/hepatitis, and cancer. Keishibukuryogan (KBG, Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan in Chinese) is a traditional Chinese/Japanese (Kampo) medicine that has been known to improve blood circulation and is also known for its anti-inflammatory or scavenging effect. In this study, we evaluated the effect of KBG in two distinct rodent models of obesity driven by either a genetic (SHR/NDmcr-cp rat model) or dietary (high-fat diet-induced mouse obesity model) mechanism. Although there was no significant effect on the body composition in either the SHR rat or the DIO mouse models, KBG treatment significantly decreased the serum level of leptin and liver TG level in the DIO mouse, but not in the SHR rat model. Furthermore, a lower fat deposition in liver and a smaller size of adipocytes in white adipose tissue were observed in the DIO mice treated with KBG. Importantly, we further found downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the KBG-treated liver, along with decreased liver TG and cholesterol level. Our present data experimentally support in fact that KBG can be an attractive Kampo medicine to improve obese status through a regulation of systemic leptin level and/or lipid metabolism.

17123761|t|Protective effects of keishibukuryogan on the kidney of spontaneously diabetic WBN/Kob rats.
17123761|a|Keishibukuryogan, one of the traditional herbal formulations, is used clinically to improve blood circulation. It consists of the following five crude drugs: Cinnamomi Cortex, Poria, Moutan Cortex, Persicae Semen and Paeoniae Radix. In this study, the effects of keishibukuryogan against renal damage in spontaneously diabetic WBN/Kob rats were examined. Oral administration of keishibukuryogan significantly attenuated urinary protein excretion and serum creatinine levels. It did not affect body weight loss and blood glucose levels, but it suppressed renal and hepatic weights of WBN/Kob rats. Keishibukuryogan also reduced fibronectin and transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) protein expression in the renal cortex. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation levels in both kidney and liver were significantly lower than those of untreated control WBN/Kob rats. Urinary excretion of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine was suppressed by keishibukuryogan treatment. These results suggest that keishibukuryogan reduces oxidative stress by hyperglycemia, and that it protects renal function and suppresses fibronectin deposition induced by TGF-beta(1) production in WBN/Kob rats.

23213558|t|Effectiveness of keishibukuryogan on chronic-stage lichenification associated with atopic dermatitis.
23213558|a|Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease with recurring episodes of itching and a chronic relapsing course. Keishibukuryogan (KBG) is a traditional herbal medicine, composed of five kinds of medical plants and has been administered to patients with blood stagnation in Japan. This study investigated the effect of KBG on the disease activity in AD (n = 45) patients. AD patients were administered KBG for 4 to 6 weeks in addition to their prescribed medications. The results showed that the SCORAD index and VAS score were significantly decreased after the administration of KBG (P < 0.01). KBG also decreased the serum LDH level significantly (P < 0.01). The global assessment of the clinical response in SCORAD index showed that 88.5% of the patients with moderate improvement to excellent response (n = 26) had a high lichenification score (lichenification score >= 2 in SCORAD). On the other hand, only 42.1% of the patients with no improvement to mild improvement (n = 19) had a high lichenification score. Furthermore, long-term administration of KBG for 9-67 weeks showed a marked improvement in patients with a high lichenification score. Therefore, KBG was found to be effective against AD, particularly in cases presenting with lichenified lesions.

21048343|t|Clustering analysis of keishibukuryogan formulas by use of self-organizing maps.
21048343|a|Kampo medicines, traditional herbal medicines in Japan, are comprised of multiple botanical raw materials that contain a number of pharmacologically active substances. Conventionally, the quality control of kampo medicines has been performed by analyzing the contents of two or three representative components. However, it is not sufficient to check quality only with a limited number of specific components. We performed HPLC of 287 lots of keishibukuryogan formulas, calculated the areas of 11 components on chromatograms as feature values and made a cluster analysis using self-organizing maps (SOMs). We verified the precision (repeatability and intermediate precision) of clustering results when using the same samples and successfully established an clustering method using SOMs that is capable of precisely clustering differences in HPLC-fingerprints among pharmaceutical manufacturers, differences in HPLC-fingerprints due to the combination ratios of botanical raw materials, and differences in HPLC-fingerprints due to changes in component contents caused by time-course deterioration. Consequently, we could confirm that this method is useful for controlling the quality of multiple component drugs and analyzing quality differences.

21669429|t|Effects of the Kampo medication keishibukuryogan on blood pressure in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
21669429|a|OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of keishibukuryogan (TJ-25)-a medicine of the Kampo tradition (the Japanese adaptation of Chinese herbal medicine)-on middle-aged women with high blood pressure. METHODS: The records of 77 peri- and postmenopausal women with high-normal blood pressure or hypertension were analyzed retrospectively. The women had participated in the Systematic Health and Nutrition Education Program at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Tokyo, Japan, and had received education only (controls; n = 47) or education and treatment with TJ-25 (n = 30). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were comparable. After approximately 6 months, women in the TJ-25 group showed significant reductions in their systolic blood pressure (from 148.4mm Hg to 134.8mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (from 89.7 mm Hg to 83.7 mm Hg), pulse rate (from 79.5 beats/min to 73.5 beats/min), and resting energy expenditure (from 1552 kcal/day to 1373 kcal/day). Several menopausal symptoms including perspiration, difficulty in initiating sleep, nonrestorative sleep, and headaches/dizziness were also improved. In addition, women in the TJ-25 group had increased health-related quality of life scores in the domains of physical health and life satisfaction. CONCLUSION: TJ-25 alleviates menopausal symptoms and concurrently lowers the blood pressure of middle-aged women with high blood pressure.

25298828|t|Examination of clinical efficacy of keishibukuryogan on non-specific complaints associated with varicose veins of the lower extremity.
25298828|a|The subjective symptoms of varicose veins of the lower extremity often include malaise, numbness, coldness, pain, and pruritus of the lower extremity, and relieving these complaints is important in managing the quality of life of patients. We have examined the clinical efficacy of keishibukuryogan, a Kampo prescription for improving oketsu (impaired microcirculation, congestion), on non-specific complaints associated with varicose veins of the lower extremity. Keishibukuryogan was administered to 30 patients with non-specific complaints associated with varicose veins of the lower extremity for 12 weeks, resulting in improvements in the scores of subjective symptoms, severity of varicose veins, and oketsu as well as an increase in skin perfusion pressure. And especially the effect was remarkable in female. In addition, oketsu was shown to be involved in the subjective symptoms associated with varicose veins of the lower extremity, demonstrating efficacy of keishibukuryogan. No adverse drug reaction or abnormal laboratory result was observed in patients receiving keishibukuryogan, and the rate of general improvement and usefulness was 73.3%. It was suggested that keishibukuryogan was useful to improve the symptoms of patients with non-specific complaints associated with varicose veins of the lower extremity especially in female patients.

17673196|t|Identification of a predictive biomarker for the beneficial effect of a Kampo (Japanese traditional) medicine keishibukuryogan in rheumatoid arthritis patients.
17673196|a|OBJECTIVES: Kampo (Japanese traditional herbal) medicines are now ethically used in Japan as pharmaceutical grade prescription drugs. However, there are distinct groups of responders and non-responders to Kampo medicines. We searched for biomarker candidates to discriminate responders from non-responders to keishibukuryogan (KBG); one of the most frequently used Kampo medicines. DESIGN AND METHODS: A combination of SELDI technology and a decision tree analysis with proprietary developed bioinformatics tools was applied to 41 (32 for tree construction and 9 for validation test) plasma samples obtained from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. A candidate biomarker protein was identified using LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The constructed tree with measurable reliability contained only a single peak which was identified as haptoglobin alpha 1 chain (Hpalpha1). CONCLUSION: Hpalpha1 is a biomarker candidate for discriminating responders from non-responders to KBG treatment for RA. The present results may open the way to the establishment of "evidence-based" complementary and alternative medicine.

24639885|t|Identification of a predictive biomarker for the beneficial effect of keishibukuryogan, a kampo (Japanese traditional) medicine, on patients with climacteric syndrome.
24639885|a|Keishibukuryogan (KBG; Guizhi-Fuling-Wan in Chinese) is one of the Kampo (Japanese traditional) medicines used to treat patients with climacteric syndrome. KBG can be used by patients who cannot undergo hormone replacement therapy due to a history of breast cancer. We evaluated whether cytosine-adenine (CA) repeat polymorphism of the estrogen receptor b gene can be a predictor of the beneficial effect of KBG on climacteric syndrome. We also investigated the relationship between CA repeat polymorphism, the patients' profiles, and the therapeutic effect. We found that CA was an SS, SL, or LL genotype according to the number of repeats. We studied 39 consecutive patients with climacteric disorders who took KBG for 12   weeks. The diagnosis of climacteric disorders was made on the basis of the Kupperman index. KBG significantly improved the patients' climacteric symptoms (i.e., vasomotor symptoms in the patients with the LL genotype and melancholia in the patients with the SL genotype). No relationship between the patients' profiles and CA repeat polymorphism was recognized. CA repeat polymorphism could thus be a potential biomarker to predict the efficacy of KBG in climacteric syndrome, and its use will help to reduce the cost of treating this syndrome by focusing the administration of KBG on those most likely to benefit from it.

21253500|t|The traditional Japanese formula keishibukuryogan inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines by dermal endothelial cells.
21253500|a|Keishibukuryogan (KBG) is one of the traditional herbal formulations widely administered to patients with blood stagnation for improving blood circulation; currently, it is the most frequently prescribed medicine in Japan. KBG has been reported to improve conjunctional microcirculation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of KBG and paeoniflorin, a bioactive compound of KBG, in inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines using human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (HDMECs). The authors observed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1    g/mL) stimulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in HDMECs. KBG treatment (10   mg/mL) significantly suppressed the mRNA levels of migration inhibitory factor (MIF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a in LPS-stimulated cultured HDMECs. Similarly, paeoniflorin significantly suppressed the mRNA levels of these cytokines in LPS-stimulated cultured HDMECs. ELISA showed that KBG and paeoniflorin suppressed the production of MIF, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a in LPS-stimulated HDMECs. Moreover, KBG and paeoniflorin decreased the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in these cells. These results suggest that KBG may be useful for improving microvascular inflammation in patients with skin diseases.

21804329|t|[Effects of estrogen and keishibukuryogan on hot flash-like symptoms induced by yohimbine in ovariectomized rats].
21804329|a|Hot flash (HF) is the most common phenomenon in climacteric symptoms which often develop concomitantly with a decrease in estrogen in postmenopausal women. The onset mechanism of the hot flash is complicated and remains unclear. To date, some animal models of postmenopausal HF have been devised, but they are not fully available because of the difficulty in producing them. It is thought that hyperactivity of the central a-adrenergic system with a decrease in estrogen participates in the onset of postmenopausal HF. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether a HF model could be easily produced by administering yohimbine (YOH), a presynaptic a   -adrenoceptor antagonist which promotes norepinephrine release, to female rats. HF-like symptoms such as a rise in tail skin temperature and a fall in rectal temperature were shown in the rats who received YOH (3 mg/kg) subcutaneously seven days after the ovariectomy (OVX). Such symptoms following YOH administration were observed in sham rats as well, but were much more clearly noted in OVX rats. We next examined the effects of various drugs, which are clinically effective against postmenopausal HF, on HF-like symptoms in YOH-treated OVX rats: clonidine, a presynaptic a   -adrenoceptor agonist which inhibits norepinephrine release; b-estradiol as an estrogen; and Keishibukuryogan, a Kampo medicine. These drugs inhibited HF-like symptoms in YOH-treated OVX rats. These results suggest that the activity of the a-adrenergic system is enhanced with a decrease in estrogen in OVX rats whereby YOH causes HF-like symptoms more conspicuously than in sham rats. Therefore, it is thought that YOH-treated OVX rats will be a novel and simple model of postmenopausal HF.

20388146|t|The traditional Japanese formula keishibukuryogan reduces liver injury and inflammation in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
20388146|a|The Kampo formula keishibukuryogan (KBG, Guizhifulingwan) is frequently used in traditional Japanese and Chinese medicine to treat several symptoms and manifests anti-inflammatory and scavenging effects. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and has the potential to evolve to liver cirrhosis through chronic inflammation and steatohepatisis (NASH). We have recently reported the KBG significant effectiveness on liver injury in a NASH animal model that prompted us to prescribe to KBG (TJ-25). We performed a retrospective study and reviewed the charts of outpatients who were prescribed KBG for 8-12 weeks due to non-liver-related symptoms (n= 11) over the past year to evaluate the clinical outcome. In six of these cases, biochemical and ultrasound signs of NAFLD were observed. KBG led to a significant reduction in liver injury tests and blood cholesterol but had no effects on body weight in all NAFLD cases. Further, liver tests and lipid profiles returned to baseline values when KBG treatment was stopped. On the basis of data on a small number of subjects, we suggest that the use of KBG is a safe complementary treatment in patients with NAFLD. While it is unlikely that Kampo formulas may substitute the current nutritional approaches to the metabolic syndrome, future studies should address the possibility of an additive effect, possibly through anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

21738077|t|The TU-025 keishibukuryogan clinical trial for hot flash management in postmenopausal women: results and lessons for future research.
21738077|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of TU-025, keishibukuryogan, a Japanese prescription herbal medicine used for hot flash management, in American women. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial enrolled 178 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 58 years with a Mayo hot flash score greater than 28 per week who met other inclusion criteria. After a 1-week placebo run-in period, participants were randomly assigned placebo, or 7.5 g/day, or 12.5 g/day groups, for 12 weeks. Primary and secondary outcomes were measured using the Mayo Clinic Hot Flash Diary, the Greene Climacteric Index, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: At 3 months, hot flash scores, climacteric symptoms, and sleep quality improved by 34% in the placebo group, 40% in the 7.5 g/day group, and 38% in the 12.5 g/day group. (P < 0.001). However, the differences in changes between groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.990). Diarrhea unexpectedly developed in 20% of participants receiving active medication. CONCLUSIONS: For American women, unlike the clinical experience for Japanese women, TU-025 did not significantly reduce the frequency and severity of hot flash symptoms, improve climacteric symptoms, or benefit sleep quality. This study identified several potentially significant methodological factors to be considered in future scientific assessments of traditional Asian medicines.

20098017|t|Efficacy of keishibukuryogan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, in treating cold sensation and numbness after stroke: clinical improvement and skin temperature normalization in 22 stroke patients.
20098017|a|Cold sensation and numbness have been reported as post-stroke sensory sequelae attributable to distal axonopathy, which is caused by chronic ischemia of diseased limbs resulting from dysfunction of vasomotor regulatory systems. Keishibukuryogan is a traditional herbal medicine used to treat symptoms of peripheral ischemia such as cold extremities. This study investigated clinical improvement and skin temperature in peripheral ischemia patients to determine the efficacy of keishibukuryogan in alleviating post-stroke cold sensation and numbness. Twenty-two stroke patients with cold sensation and/or numbness were enrolled in this study. Subjective cold sensation and numbness, evaluated using the visual analogue scale, were found in 21 and 31 limbs, respectively. The skin temperature of diseased and healthy limbs was recorded. We observed all patients for 4 weeks and 17 patients for 8 weeks after administration of keishibukuryogan. The skin temperature of diseased limbs was significantly higher than baseline at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, whereas that of healthy limbs did not change significantly. Cold sensation and numbness were significantly improved at 4 weeks and 8 weeks compared to baseline. Keishibukuryogan administration resulted in warming of diseased limbs and improved cold sensation and numbness, probably by increasing peripheral blood flow.

27182114|t|Keishibukuryogan is not carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats.
27182114|a|Keishibukuryogan is a traditional Japanese medicine widely administered to patients with menopausal symptoms. Because humans use it on a long-term basis, we believed that a carcinogenicity study was warranted. We orally administered keishibukuryogan (TJ-25) extract powder to 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats [Crl:CD(SD)], which were divided into four dosage groups-0 (water for injection), 100, 500 and 2,500 mg/kg/day for 24 months. We found that TJ-25 did not affect the survival rate of either sex. Furthermore, it did not affect the clinical condition of the rats, number of superficial tumors found by palpation, body weight, food consumption, hematology, or gross pathological findings. The severity of degeneration of muscle fiber in the femoral skeletal muscle increased slightly in males and females in the 2,500 mg/kg/day group, but TJ-25 did not increase the number of tumors found on histopathological examination. In our study, oral administration of TJ-25 extract powder in rats for 24 months was not associated with an increased incidence of tumors.

18955217|t|A Proteomic Approach for the Diagnosis of 'Oketsu' (blood stasis), a Pathophysiologic Concept of Japanese Traditional (Kampo) Medicine.
18955217|a|'Oketsu' is a pathophysiologic concept in Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine, primarily denoting blood stasis/stagnant syndrome. Here we have explored plasma protein biomarkers and/or diagnostic algorithms for 'Oketsu'. Sixteen rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were treated with keishibukuryogan (KBG), a representative Kampo medicine for improving 'Oketsu'. Plasma samples were diagnosed as either having an 'Oketsu' (n = 19) or 'non-Oketsu' (n = 29) state according to Terasawa's 'Oketsu' scoring system. Protein profiles were obtained by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) and hierarchical clustering and decision tree analyses were performed. KBG treatment for 4 or 12 weeks decreased the 'Oketsu' scores significantly. SELDI protein profiles gave 266 protein peaks, whose expression was significantly different between the 'Oketsu' and 'non-Oketsu' states. Hierarchical clustering gave three major clusters (I, II, III). The majority (68.4%) of 'Oketsu' samples were clustered into one cluster as the principal component of cluster I. The remaining 'Oketsu' profiles constituted a minor component of cluster II and were all derived from patients cured of the 'Oketsu' state at 12 weeks. Construction of the decision tree addressed the possibility of developing a diagnostic algorithm for 'Oketsu'. A reduction in measurement/pre-processing conditions (from 55 to 16) gave a similar outcome in the clustering and decision tree analyses. The present study suggests that the pathophysiologic concept of Kampo medicine 'Oketsu' has a physical basis in terms of the profile of blood proteins. It may be possible to establish a set of objective criteria for diagnosing 'Oketsu' using a combination of proteomic and bioinformatics-based classification methods.

25229199|t|Japanese herbal medicines shosaikoto, inchinkoto, and juzentaihoto inhibit high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in db/db mice.
25229199|a|Few studies have investigated the effects of Japanese herbal medicines on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To the best of our knowledge, only one study has examined whether high-fat (HF) diet-fed db/db mice are appropriate animal models of NASH. We investigated the effects of four types of Japanese herbal medicines (shosaikoto (TJ-9), inchinkoto (TJ-135), juzentaihoto (TJ-48), and keishibukuryogan (TJ-25)) on hepatic lesions of HF diet-fed db/db mice. Db/db mice were divided into six groups: control diet (control); HF diet (HF); and HF diet supplemented with TJ-9, TJ-135, TJ-48, or TJ-25 (TJ-9, TJ-135, TJ-48, and TJ-25, respectively). Mice were killed after 6 weeks of treatment, and biochemical and pathological analyses were performed. Mice in the HF group consistently developed histopathological features consistent with definite NASH, and marked necroinflammation occurred. Serum alanine aminotransferase levels in the TJ-9, TJ-135, and TJ-48 groups were significantly improved compared with those in the HF group. With regard to liver histology, TJ-9 and TJ-48 significantly improved lobular inflammation, and TJ-135 significantly improved ballooning degeneration. We have shown that HF diet-fed db/db mice are animal models that correctly recapitulate the histopathology of human NASH and that TJ-9, TJ-135, and TJ-48 inhibit necroinflammatory activity in this model.

27803912|t|Efficacy of Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine for treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: A retrospective case series study.
27803912|a|AIM: To investigate Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine's effectiveness on cancer chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), we carried out this retrospective study. METHODS: By searching our outpatient database of 3154 patients who consulted our outpatient clinic of Japanese-Oriental (Kampo) Medicine at Chiba University Hospital from November 2005 to December 2010, a total of 281 patients diagnosed with cancer were identified. Twenty-four patients out of the 281 patients identified met the following three conditions and were eligible for further investigation of the effectiveness of Kampo treatment: At least one course of cancer chemotherapy had been administered; numbness and pain appeared after the chemotherapy; and CIPN was diagnosed before they were given Kampo treatment. RESULTS: The 24 patients included 6 males and 18 females and ranged in age from 39 to 86 (mean 61.2    11.5) years old. Kampo formulas were individually chosen by Kampo expert doctors based on Kampo-specific diagnostics. Beneficial outcomes were obtained by Kampo treatment in 20 out of the 24 cases (83.3%). Nine out 20 cases had a major response (the numbness and pain showed improvement or reduction by 50% or more), with 7 of 9 cases showing a more than 70% symptom reduction. Eleven out of 20 cases showed a minor response (less than 50% symptom reduction), and 4 out of the 24 cases had no beneficial response. The most frequently used formula was goshajinkigan (GJG), followed by hachimijiogan (HJG) and keishibukuryogan. Thirteen of the 24 cases (54.2%) were prescribed aconite root-containing formulas including GJG and HJG. Aconite root has "warming" effects and ameliorates pain and numbness; 21 out of 24 cases (87.5%) in total used warming formulas such as aconite root-containing formulas to reduce CIPN. CONCLUSION: Our current study suggested that Kampo formulas chosen based on Kampo-specific diagnostics could be for treating CIPN that is refractory to conventional medicine.

27107084|t|Anti-inflammatory Activity of Hangeshashinto in IL-1b-stimulated Gingival and Periodontal Ligament Fibroblasts.
27107084|a|UNASSIGNED: Although a large number of Kampo, Japanese traditional medicines, have been used for the treatment of oral diseases, little is known on their relative potency and endotoxin contamination. In order to obtain basic data for clinical applications, 10 Kampo, and 25 constituent plant extracts were tested for the contamination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-like substances, and anti-inflammatory activity. Human gingival (HGF) and periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLF) were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Viable cell number was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Prostaglandin (PGE2) was determined by enzyme immunoassay. Cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 protein expressions were determined by western blot. COX activity was measured using Cox Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit. LPS, quantified by Endotoxin assay kit, was undetectable or relatively low in the test samples except for rikkosan and unseiin. Hangeshashinto potently inhibited PGE2 production by interleukin (IL)-1b-stimulated HPLFs and HGFs. Hangeshashinto suppressed the expression of COX-2 protein, but not that of COX-1 protein in IL-1b-induced HGF cells. Hangeshashinto slightly, but not significantly, inhibited both COX-1 and COX-2 activity. The present study provides the basis for clinical application of hangeshashinto for the treatment of stomatitis.

2670285|a|In this paper the immunosuppressive effects of Gui Zhi Tang (a famous Chinese medicine) on the murine immune functions are reported. Varying dosages of Gui Zhi Tang administrated orally, i.p. and i.m. were able to inhibit the amounts of PFC, SRFC and the DTH response induced by BSA and the proliferation response of murine spleen cells to Con A and LPS. Further studies showed that Gui Zhi Tang had the inhibitory effect on Interleukin-2 production of murine spleen cells, which might be one of the mechanisms leading to the immunosuppressive effects of Gui Zhi Tang.

17541150|t|Anti-inflammatory effect of oyaksungisan in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from cerebral infarction patients.
17541150|a|Oyaksungisan, the herbal prescription composed of eleven herbs, has been widely used in treatment of cerebral infarct in Oriental Medicine. However, the mechanisms by which the herbal formula affects on the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in cerebral infarction patients remain unknown yet. The secretory levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased in both LPS and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cerebral infarction patients. However, pretreatment with oyaksungisan significantly inhibited the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory in PBMCs. Also, oyaksungisan induced a significant increase of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in PBMCs. Thus, these data indicate that oyaksungisan may be beneficial in the cessation of inflammatory processes of cerebral infarct through suppression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 and induction of TGF-beta1.

14719288|t|Effects of da ding feng zhu decoction in 30 cases of liver fibrosis.
14719288|a|To study the clinical effects of Da Ding Feng Zhu ([symbol: see text]) Decoction on liver fibrosis. 56 patients with liver fibrosis due to chronic hepatitis B were randomly divided into a treatment group (30 cases treated with Da Ding Feng Zhu Decoction) and a control group (26 cases treated with colchicine). The serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen III (PC-III), IV collagen (IV-C) and Laminin (LN) of the patients were determined, compared and analyzed before treatment and after 3-month treatment in the two groups. The results showed that in the treatment group, the levels of HA, PC-III, IV-C and LN after 3-month treatment were significantly lowered as compared to that before treatment (P < 0.01). In the control group, only the HA level was obviously lowered (P < 0.05). There was an significant difference (P < 0.05) in PC-III and IV-C and a very significant difference (P < 0.01) in HA after treatment between the two groups. It is therefore concluded that Da Ding Feng Zhu Decoction can lower serum indexes of liver fibrosis.

24223055|t|A valid approach in refractory glossodynia: a single-institution 5-year experience treating with Japanese traditional herbal (kampo) medicine.
24223055|a|Glossodynia is often refractory to conventional medicine, and there is only limited evidence to guide clinicians in its management. Patients with refractory glossodynia are often introduced to Japanese traditional herbal (Kampo) medicine experts under such circumstances because Kampo medicine has become known in Japan to be effective in treating a wide variety of symptoms refractory to conventional medicine. Herein, we report our single-institution 5-year experience treating patients with Kampo medicine for primary glossodynia that was refractory to conventional medicine. We found that 69.2% of patients reported a beneficial effect of Kampo medicine on glossodynia, and the average onset of improvement was 8.0    7.7 weeks after starting Kampo treatment. The top two frequently used Kampo medicines for glossodynia were seinetsuhokito and mibakuekkito among high responders who showed a decrease of severity by 50% or more. The top four most overlapped herbs among effective Kampo medicines for glossodynia were Glycyrrhiza Root, Ginseng Root, Hoelen, and Atractylodes (lancea) Rhizome, which compose an essential Kampo prescription called shikunshito. Although more research is required to further clarify the effectiveness of Kampo medicine, it has valid efficacy even in cases of glossodynia that remain incurable by conventional treatments.

26902927|t|Inhibition of PA endonuclease activity of influenza virus RNA polymerase by Kampo medicines.
26902927|a|To find a novel influenza inhibitor targeting the endonuclease activity of influenza A virus polymerase acidic protein (PA), which is essential for the acquisition of primers for viral mRNA transcription, seven Kampo extracts were tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit endonuclease activity of the recombinant PA protein that was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The Kampo medicines Kakkonto, Shosaikoto, Saikokeishito, Keishito, Maobushisaishinto, and Maoto, but not Chikujountanto, inhibited PA endonuclease activity in a dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that Kampo medicines are good sources providing a structural lead for optimization of an influenza endonuclease inhibitor.

18222735|t|Effects of goshuyuto on lateralization of pupillary dynamics in headache.
18222735|a|Autonomic nervous imbalance is implicated in chronic headache. We investigated the effects of goshuyuto-a representative Kampo medicine for headache-on the lateralization of the pupillary autonomic nervous system by using binocular infrared video pupillography. Patients with chronic headache were administered goshuyuto extract for 1 month (1st stage). Goshuyuto was discontinued for 1 month, following which the patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: placebo and goshuyuto. In the 2nd stage, the respective groups were administered placebo or goshuyuto for 3 months. The average laterality of the pupillary dynamics decreased significantly in the goshuyuto group. These results suggest that the reduction of the difference in pupillary autonomic balance between the left and right eyes might be one of the action mechanisms of goshuyuto to relieve chronic headache.

16870083|t|The efficacy of goshuyuto, a typical Kampo (Japanese herbal medicine) formula, in preventing episodes of headache.
16870083|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of goshuyuto, a typical Kampo formula, in preventing episodes of headache in chronic headache patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Because the treatment target of a Kampo formula is decided on a basis different to that of Western medicine, we first selected patients belonging to a subgroup that responded to goshuyuto before conducting the usual randomized controlled trial. During stage 1, the subjects were instructed to orally consume goshuyuto for 4 weeks. Only those subjects judged as responders advanced to stage 2, during which a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted. The subjects consumed the same dose of goshuyuto or placebo for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 91 subjects enrolled in stage 1, 60 were judged as responders. Of these, 53 advanced to stage 2; 28 were assigned to the goshuyuto group and 25 to the placebo group. The decrease in the number of days on which headache episodes occurred was greater in the goshuyuto group than in the placebo group (2.6 +/- 3.7 vs. 0.3 +/- 4.0 days, p = 0.034); no difference was observed with regard to the reduction in the frequency of consuming reliever medications (2.2 +/- 4.0 vs. 1.4 +/- 8.2, p = 0.672). Improvement in the associated symptoms was observed in more than 50% of the subjects in the goshuyuto group. CONCLUSION: Goshuyuto is useful in preventing episodes of headache in chronic headache patients. Responder-limited design is a candidate for evaluating Kampo medicine.

19182382|t|Goshuyuto, a traditional Japanese medicine, and aqueous extracts of Evodiae Fructus constrict isolated rat aorta via adrenergic and/or serotonergic receptors.
19182382|a|Effects of goshuyuto, a traditional Japanese medicine, on vascular constriction were examined using isolated strips of rat aorta. Goshuyuto (1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-3) g/ml) caused constriction of aorta strips in a dose-dependent manner. The vasoconstrictive effects of goshuyuto were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with prazosin, an adrenergic alpha(1) receptor antagonist. The constrictive effects were partially inhibited by pretreatment with BRL15572, a 5-HT(1D) antagonist, and ketanserin, a 5-HT(2A) antagonist. However, the constrictive effects were not inhibited by pretreatment with SB216641, a 5-HT(1B) antagonist, or propranolol, an adrenergic beta receptor antagonist. In addition, aqueous extracts of Evodiae Fructus, one of the constituent medicinal herbs of goshuyuto, caused constriction of aorta strips strongly, but aqueous extracts of Zizyphi Fructus, Ginseng Radix, and Zingiberis Rhizoma, the other constituents of goshuyuto, did not have much effect on the vascular response of rat aorta strips. Also, synephrine, which is one of the ingredients of Evodiae Fructus, constricted the rat aorta. These results suggest that goshuyuto constricts rat aorta strips and that the mechanisms involve the adrenergic and/or serotonergic receptors. Also, it may be suggested that Evodiae Fructus and synephrine play the important role in the vasoconstrictive effects of goshuyuto on rat aorta strips.

17030300|t|Kampo medicines as alternatives for treatment of migraine: six case studies.
17030300|a|Kampo is a well-recognized form of traditional medicine in Japan. This paper reports upon six cases of successful use of Kampo medicines, herbal medicine preparations, for the treatment of migraine. Most of the patients had been treated with conventional medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or triptans, but were not satisfied with the outcomes of these conventional treatments with regard to their effectiveness or feelings of discomfort after administration. We administered two Kampo medicines, goshuyuto for prevention of migraine and senkyuchachosan as a painkiller. Both Kampo medicines worked successfully in the treatment of migraine and the patients were satisfied with their effects. Kampo medicine seems a favorable candidate for alternative therapy of migraine.

24291839|a|Doctors in any department should have at least minimum knowledge of Kampo medicines. However, doctors who specialize in neurology often have inadequate knowledge of Kampo medicines. The efficacy of Kampo medicines in treating intractable diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases is not adequately understood and needs to be investigated in the future. On the other hand, Kampo medicines are often effective for treating common symptoms such as headache, dysesthesia, pain, and vertigo, encountered in daily medical practice. Because many patients suffer from these symptoms, the impact of these symptoms on our society is not small, even though the causes of these symptoms are not crucial. Having the skill to prescribe even a dozen or so Kampo medicines (for example, goshuyuto, goreisan, goshajinkigan, sokeikakketsuto) increases the treatment options and may be very beneficial in daily medical practice. In this article, I provide instructions on the use of representative Kampo medicines and present some case reports to elucidate their use. Amassing and sharing clinical experiences regarding the use of Kampo medicines would strengthen the medical evidences of Kampo medicines.

24167975|t|[Effects of rikkunshito on postoperative anorexia].
24167975|a|Rikkunshito is a traditional Japanese medicine used to treat a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms. In several previous studies, it was demonstrated that rikkunshito stimulates gastrointestinal movement, accelerates gastric emptying, and promotes gastric adaptive relaxation. Clinically, it is known that rikkunshito attenuates dyspeptic symptoms, appetite loss, and gastroesophageal reflux after gastrointestinal surgery and in chemotherapy-induced nausea and anorexia. A recent study has demonstrated that rikkunshito affects the appetite-enhancing hormone ghrelin. Rikkunshito was also reported to increase plasma ghrelin levels and to enhance the action of ghrelin. Rikkunshito may alleviate dyspeptic symptoms after gastrointestinal surgery through its prokinetic effects and ghrelin.

23964146|t|Rikkunshito improves globus sensation in patients with proton-pump inhibitor-refractory laryngopharyngeal reflux.
23964146|a|AIM: To investigate the effect of rikkunshito on laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms and gastric emptying in patients with proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory LPR. METHODS: In total, 22 patients with LPR were enrolled. Following a 2-wk treatment with PPI monotherapy, PPI-refractory LPR patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups (rikkunshito alone or rikkunshito plus the PPI, lansoprazole). LPR symptoms were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) score, gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), and gastric emptying was assessed using the radio-opaque marker method prior to and 4 wk following treatments. RESULTS: The 4-wk treatment with rikkunshito alone and with rikkunshito plus the PPI significantly decreased the globus sensation VAS scores. The VAS score for sore throat was significantly decreased following treatment with rikkunshito plus PPI but not by rikkunshito alone. Neither treatment significantly changed the GSRS scores. Rikkunshito improved delayed gastric emptying. We found a significant positive correlation between improvements in globus sensation and in gastric emptying (r   = 0.4582, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Rikkunshito improved globus sensation in patients with PPI-refractory LPR, in part, because of stimulation of gastric emptying. Thus, rikkunshito is an effective treatment for PPI-refractory LPR.

25038801|t|Enhancement of catecholamine release from PC12 cells by the traditional Japanese medicine, rikkunshito.
25038801|a|BACKGROUND: Rikkunshito is a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that is used to treat appetite loss associated with cancer and other disorders. The formulation contains various constituents that influence cell signaling, and rikkunshito may accordingly affect human homeostasis through multiple regulatory pathways, including those governed by the endocrine system. We investigated the actions of rikkunshito on catecholamine release from PC12 cells, an adrenal chromaffin cell line. METHODS: The actions of rikkunshito on PC12 cells were evaluated by measuring intracellular cAMP levels, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) mRNA expression levels, and catecholamine levels in the culture medium. The transcriptional activation of VIP gene by rikkunshito was assessed by using a VIP promoter-driven reporter gene assay. RESULTS: Rikkunshito dose-dependently enhanced forskolin-induced elevations in cAMP in PC12 cells, and also increased the gene expression of TH and VIP. The transcriptional activation of VIP gene by rikkunshito was confirmed. Norepinephrine and dopamine secretion into the culture medium of PC12 cells were also dose-dependently augmented by rikkunshito and/or forskolin, but experiments with a protein kinase C (PKC) activator and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor revealed that the effects of rikkunshito were not simply due to the modulation of PKC or phosphodiesterase activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that rikkunshito enhances the release of catecholamines by a novel mechanism involving cAMP.

23053427|t|Intragastric administration of rikkunshito stimulates upper gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying in conscious dogs.
23053427|a|BACKGROUND: Traditional Japanese medicine, known as Kampo medicine, consists of mixtures of several medicinal herbs widely used to treat upper gastrointestinal disorders in Japan. Rikkunshito, one of these medicines, has not been evaluated with respect to its influence on gastrointestinal motor activity. We investigated the effect of rikkunshito on upper gastrointestinal motility and plasma ghrelin concentrations in conscious dogs. METHODS: Contractile response to intragastric administration of rikkunshito was studied via surgically implanted force transducers. A powdered extract of rikkunshito (1.3, 2.7, and 4.0 g) dissolved in water was administered into the stomachs of normal and vagotomized dogs before feeding and gastric emptying was evaluated. Several inhibitors of gastrointestinal motility (atropine, hexamethonium, and ondansetron) were injected intravenously before intragastric administration of rikkunshito. Plasma acylated ghrelin levels after intragastric administration of rikkunshito were measured. RESULTS: In a fasting state, intragastric administration of rikkunshito induced phasic contractions in the duodenum and jejunum in normal dogs. Rikkunshito-induced contractions were inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium and ondansetron. In vagotomized dogs, rikkunshito induced phasic contractions, similar to normal dogs. Gastric emptying was accelerated by intragastric administration of rikkunshito in a dose-dependent manner. The plasma acylated ghrelin level 150 min after intragastric administration of 4.0 g of rikkunshito was significantly higher than the control value. CONCLUSIONS: Intragastric administration of rikkunshito stimulates gastrointestinal contractions in the interdigestive state through cholinergic neurons and 5-HT type 3 receptors. Moreover, rikkunshito increases plasma acylated ghrelin levels. Rikkunshito may alleviate gastrointestinal disorders through its prokinetic effects.

20721287|t|Rikkunshito and ghrelin.
20721287|a|Rikkunshito is a popular Japanese traditional medicine that is prescribed in Japan to treat various gastrointestinal tract disorders. In a double-blind controlled study, rikkunshito significantly ameliorated dysmotility-like dyspepsia and brought about a generalized improvement in upper gastric symptoms such as nausea and anorexia when compared with a control group. Several studies in rats have shown enhanced gastric emptying and a protective effect on gastric mucosa injury with rikkunshito administration. In addition, rikkunshito in combination with an anti-emetic drug is effective against anorexia and vomiting that occur as adverse reactions to chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer. However, the mechanism by which rikkunshito alleviates gastrointestinal disorders induced by anticancer agents remains unclear. It has recently been shown that rikkunshito ameliorates cisplatin-induced anorexia by mediating an increase in the circulating ghrelin concentration. Moreover, Fujitsuka et al. found that decreased contractions of the antrum and duodenum in rats treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor were reversed by rikkunshito via enhancement of the circulating ghrelin concentration. These findings show that rikkunshito may be useful for treatment of anorexia and may provide a new strategy for improvement of upper gastrointestinal dysfunction.

24766295|t|Randomized clinical trial: rikkunshito in the treatment of functional dyspepsia--a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
24766295|a|BACKGROUND: Rikkunshito, a standardized Japanese herbal medicine, is thought to accelerate gastric emptying and relieve dyspepsia, although no large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of rikkunshito have been conducted. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of rikkunshito for treating functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: FD patients received 2.5 g rikkunshito or placebo three times a day for 8 weeks in this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. The primary end point was the proportion of responders at 8 weeks after starting test drug, determined by global patient assessment (GPA). The improvement in four major dyspepsia symptoms severity scale was also evaluated. In addition, plasma ghrelin levels were investigated before and after treatment. KEY RESULTS: Two hundred forty-seven patients were randomly assigned. In the eighth week, the rikkunshito group had more GPA responders (33.6%) than the placebo (23.8%), although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). Epigastric pain was significantly improved (p = 0.04) and postprandial fullness tended to improve (p = 0.06) in the rikkunshito group at week 8. Rikkunshito was relatively more effective among Helicobacter pylori-infected participants (rikkunshito: 40.0% vs placebo: 20.5%, p = 0.07), and seemed less effective among H. pylori-uninfected participants (rikkunshito: 29.3% vs placebo: 25.6%, p = 0.72). Among H. pylori-positive individuals, acyl ghrelin levels were improved just in rikkunshito group. There were no severe adverse events in both groups. CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: Administration of rikkunshito for 8 weeks reduced dyspepsia, particularly symptoms of epigastric pain and postprandial fullness.

26165077|t|[Kampo medicine (rikkunshito)].
26165077|a|Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), an acid-related disease, is usually treated with acid inhibitory drugs including proton pump inhibitor (PPI) according to the clinical practice guidelines for GERD in Japan. However, it is recognized that there are some GERD patients who are resistant to PPI treatment. There are some evidences that various traditional medicines especially for rikkunshito are often combined with Western medicines and prescribed for patients with PPI-refractory GERD at that time. Accordingly, rikkunshito may be useful for treating PPI-refractory GERD via its proper functions such as regulation of gastorintestinal motility and physiological integrity for acid exposure to the esophageal mucosa, because rikkunshito has no inhibitory action on gastric acid secretion.

19861508|t|The Traditional Japanese Medicine Rikkunshito Promotes Gastric Emptying via the Antagonistic Action of the 5-HT(3) Receptor Pathway in Rats.
19861508|a|The traditional Japanese medicine rikkunshito ameliorates the nitric oxide-associated delay in gastric emptying. Whether rikkunshito affects gastric motility associated with 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin: 5-HT) receptors or dopamine receptors is unknown. We examined the effects of rikkunshito on the delay in gastric emptying induced by 5-HT or dopamine using the phenol red method in male Wistar rats. 5-HT (0.01-1.0   mg   kg(-1), i.p.) dose dependently delayed gastric emptying, similar to the effect of the 5-HT(3) receptor agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl) biguanide (0.01-1.0   mg   kg(-1), i.p.). Dopamine also dose dependently delayed gastric emptying. The 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist ondansetron (0.04-4.0   mg   kg(-1)) and rikkunshito (125-500   mg   kg(-1)) significantly suppressed the delay in gastric emptying caused by 5-HT or 1-(3-chlorophenyl) biguanide. Hesperidin (the most active ingredient in rikkunshito) suppressed the 5-HT-induced delayed gastric emptying in a dose-dependent manner, the maximum effect of which was similar to that of ondansetron (0.4   mg   kg(-1)). The improvement obtained by rikkunshito or ondansetron in delaying gastric emptying was completely blocked by pretreatment with atropine. Rikkunshito appears to improve delay in gastric emptying via the antagonistic action of the 5-HT(3) receptor pathway.

21175995|t|Effect of rikkunshito on gastric sensorimotor function under distention.
21175995|a|BACKGROUND: The herbal medicine rikkunshito is effective for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia. Although some basic studies on the effects of rikkunshito have been reported in rats, its effects on human gastric function have not yet been clarified. Psychosocial stress induces visceral hypersensitivity and elements of rikkunshito may reasonably affect or suppress this process. We conducted a study to verify the hypothesis that rikkunshito improves stress-induced gastric hypersensitivity and/or changes in gastric wall tone. METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers (five males, four females) participated in the study. The counterbalanced regimen consisted of a 2-week period of oral administration of 7.5 g day(-1) rikkunshito, then a 2-week period without treatment. Fundic sensorimotor function was examined using a gastric barostat twice on the day after each period. Virtual reality stress was imposed during the measurements of gastric tone and electrocardiogram. KEY RESULTS: Stress induced a significant increase in heart rate (P = 0.041), gastric volume (P = 0.008), and phasic volume events (P = 0.049) and a decrease in sensory (P = 0.038), discomfort (P = 0.011), and pain (P = 0.041) thresholds of the stomach. Rikkunshito significantly reduced epigastric fullness (P = 0.037) and perceived stress (P = 0.034) following stimulation of the pain threshold, regardless of stress without the drug. Stress reduced gastric volume at the sensory threshold and increased anxiety at the discomfort threshold, and these responses were significantly inhibited by rikkunshito (P = 0.026, P = 0.022, respectively). CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: These findings suggest that rikkunshito may improve symptoms and impaired gastric accommodation under distention stimuli of the proximal stomach superimposed by stress.

27451879|t|The effects of rikkunshito on body weight loss after esophagectomy.
27451879|a|BACKGROUND: After esophagectomy, esophageal cancer patients suffer from malnutrition, anorexia, and dysfunction of digestion and absorption. Rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, reportedly attenuates gastrointestinal symptoms and appetite loss after gastrointestinal surgery. We evaluated the clinical effect of rikkunshito and its relationship with ghrelin in esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy. METHODS: This prospective nonrandomized study included 40 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy at Wakayama Medical University Hospital. They were assigned to either the control group (n  =  20, April 2011-January 2012) or the rikkunshito group (n  =  20, January 2012-August 2012). Patients in the rikkunshito group received 2.5  g of rikkunshito before every meal for 48  wk beginning 4  wk after surgery. During the 48-week treatment, we assessed body weight loss, nutritional parameters, and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal scale). The primary end point was the rate of body weight loss in two groups after the 48-week treatments. RESULTS: The rate of body weight loss was significantly less in the rikkunshito group than in the control group (P  =  0.016). The acyl ghrelin level after the 48-week treatments was significantly higher in the rikkunshito group (131.7%      74.5%) than in the control group (75.6%      47.5%, P  =  0.039). For the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal symptom scale, satisfaction of food consumption in the rikkunshito group was significantly better than in the control group at 52  wk postoperatively (P  =  0.031). CONCLUSIONS: For esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy, rikkunshito is useful for improving body weight loss in connection with an increase in plasma acyl ghrelin levels.

23756052|t|Rikkunshito and isoliquiritigenin counteract 5-HT-induced 2C receptor-mediated activation of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus.
23756052|a|Anorexia deteriorates the quality of life in patients with anorexia nervosa, stress disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and cancer. Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), serotonin (5-HT) and its 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) are implicated in anorexia. Rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, has been used to treat anorexia and gastrointestinal disorders. The present study aimed to clarify whether rikkunshito influences the 5-HT action on ARC POMC neurons. We isolated single neurons from the ARC of adult rats and measured cytosolic Ca      concentration ([Ca     ](i)) by fura-2 microfluorometry combined with immunocytochemical identification of POMC neurons. Administration of 5-HT increased [Ca     ](i) in ARC neurons, and 80% of the 5-HT-responsive neurons were immunoreactive to POMC. Rikkunshito concentration-dependently and 5-HT2CR antagonist SB242084 significantly suppressed 5-HT-induced [Ca     ](i) increases. The rikkunshito-suppressed neurons highly overlapped SB242084-suppressed neurons. Isoliquiritigenin, an ingredient of rikkunshito, suppressed 5-HT-induced [Ca     ](i) increases to a lesser extent than rikkunshito. These results demonstrate that rikkunshito counteracts 5-HT-induced 5-HT2CR-mediated Ca      signaling in ARC POMC neurons, and that isoliquiritigenin may serve as an active component of rikkunshito. The ability of rikkunshito to antagonize 5-HT action in ARC POMC neurons could underlie the rikkunshito's action to attenuate anorexia induced by excessive 5-HT release and/or action associated with psychiatric diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, and anti-cancer medicines.

26186592|t|Pharmacokinetic Profiles of Active Ingredients and Its Metabolites Derived from Rikkunshito, a Ghrelin Enhancer, in Healthy Japanese Volunteers: A Cross-Over, Randomized Study.
26186592|a|BACKGROUND: Rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has been used to treat upper gastrointestinal disorders such as functional dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux. This study investigated the exposure and pharmacokinetics of the ingredients of rikkunshito in healthy volunteers. METHODS AND RESULTS: First, an exploratory nonrandomized, open-label, one-period, noncrossover study using four healthy Japanese volunteers to detect 32 typical ingredients of rikkunshito in plasma and urine. As a result, 18 or 21 of 32 ingredients was detected in plasma or urine samples after oral administration of rikkunshito (7.5 g/day). Furthermore, a randomized, open-label, three-arm, three-period, crossover study using 21 subjects was conducted to determine the amounts of exposure and pharmacokinetic parameters of nine ingredients derived from rikkunshito (atractylodin, atractylodin carboxylic acid, pachymic acid, 3,3',4',5,6,7,8-heptamethoxyflavone, naringenin, nobiletin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid) after oral administration of rikkunshito at three different doses (2.5, 5.0, or 7.5 g/day) during each period. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the nine ingredients in plasma were characterized. The geometric means (95% confidence interval) for the Cmax of the ingredients at a dose of 7.5 g were 1570 (1210-2040), 14,300 (12,200-16,800), 91.0 (71.8-115), 105 (75.6-144), 1150 (802-1650), 35.9 (24.6-52.5), 800 (672-952), 42.8 (30.4-60.3), and 55,600 (39,600-78,100) pg/mL, respectively, and for the AUC0-last were 1760 (1290-2390), 12700 (11,100-14,600), 1210 (882-1650), 225 (157-322), 4630 (2930-7320), 35.7 (20.4-62.7), 4040 (3260-5010), 122 (88.2-168), and 832,000 (628,000-1,100,000) pg  h/mL respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the ingredients of rikkunshito that are absorbed in humans. Furthermore, we determined the pharmacokinetics of nine ingredients derived from rikkunshito. This information will be useful for elucidating the pharmacological effects of rikkunshito. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center #CTI-121801 and -142522.

24778703|t|Beneficial effects of rikkunshito, a Japanese kampo medicine, on gastrointestinal dysfunction and anorexia in combination with Western drug: a systematic review.
24778703|a|Background. Kampo medicines are traditional herbal medicines which have been approved for medicinal use by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare and are currently being used more and more, often in combination with Western drugs. Thus, the need for investigation of interactions between Kampo medicines and Western drugs is now widely recognized. Aim. To summarize the effects and drug interactions of rikkunshito, a Kampo medicine often prescribed for upper gastrointestinal disorders and anorexia. Methods. Animal and human studies were systematically reviewed to identify published data on rikkunshito. Results describing its effects were abstracted, with an emphasis on drug interactions. Results and Discussion. Rikkunshito ameliorates anorexia induced by anticancer drugs, improves quality of life scores, and can even prolong survival compared with monotherapy. Rikkunshito combined with proton pump inhibitor therapy is shown to be useful in the treatment of PPI-refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease patients and patients with gastrointestinal symptoms after endoscopic submucosal dissection. Rikkunshito reduces antidepressant-induced adverse events and improves quality of life without influencing antidepressant effects. Conclusions. Rikkunshito shows ameliorative effects on adverse reactions induced by various Western drugs and can achieve better results (e.g., anticancer drugs and proton pump inhibitor) without influencing the efficacy and bioavailability of Western drugs.

26064162|t|A New Strategy Using Rikkunshito to Treat Anorexia and Gastrointestinal Dysfunction.
26064162|a|Because the clinical condition of gastrointestinal dysfunction, including functional dyspepsia, involves tangled combinations of pathologies, there are some cases of insufficient curative efficacy. Thus, traditional herbal medicines (Kampo medicines) uniquely developed in Japan are thought to contribute to medical treatment for upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Rikkunshito is a Kampo medicine often used to treat dyspeptic symptoms. Over the past few years, several studies have investigated the efficacy of rikkunshito for dysmotility, for example, upper abdominal complaints, in animals and humans. Rikkunshito ameliorated the decrease in gastric motility and anorexia in cisplatin-treated rats, stress-loaded mice, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-treated rats by enhancing plasma ghrelin levels via serotonin2B/2C receptor antagonism. In addition, rikkunshito ameliorated the decrease in food intake in aged mice and stress-loaded decreased gastric motility via enhanced ghrelin receptor signaling. Several clinical studies revealed that rikkunshito was effective in ameliorating upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including dyspepsia, epigastric pain, and postprandial fullness. In this review, we discuss these studies and propose additional evidence-based research that may promote the clinical use of Kampo medicines, particularly rikkunshito, for treating anorexia and gastrointestinal dysfunction.

19108494|t|[Effects of rikkunshito on the postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after laparoscopic gynecological surgery].
19108494|a|BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of unignorable complications after general anesthesia. The aim of this study was to examine prophylactic effects of TSUMURA rikkunshito (TJ-43), a herbal medicine consisting of eight herbs, on PONV after laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: One hundred and forty-two female patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery (ASA-PS1-2) were randomly allocated to one of two groups receiving rikkunshito (n = 91) and control (n = 51). The oral administration of 2.5 g of TJ-43 was commenced the night before surgery and was continued for 3 days after surgery. The suppository form containing 1.5 g of TJ-43 was used during surgery. RESULTS: There were no significant differences of the incidence of PONV between the two groups. The patterns of change in the degree of PONV were similar between the two groups, although TJ-43 group showed slightly earlier reduction in symptom scores. The patients with TJ-43 showed earlier postoperative recovery of oral meal intake. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative administration of TJ-43 showed a possible effectiveness to reduce the severity of PONV and to promote earlier recovery of oral meal intake after gynecological laparoscopic surgery.

23856127|t|Effects of rikkunshito, a kampo medicine, on quality of life after proximal gastrectomy.
23856127|a|BACKGROUND: The loss of the gastroesophageal junction after proximal gastrectomy (PG) induces various gastrointestinal symptoms, such as regurgitation, anorexia, and body weight loss, leading to impairment of the postoperative quality of life. In the present study, we investigated the long-term quality of life and the effects of rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo), on the gastrointestinal symptoms and plasma ghrelin levels in patients with gastric cancer who had undergone PG. METHODS: Nineteen patients who had undergone PG> 6  mo before entry into the present study were enrolled. The plasma ghrelin levels, body weight, appetite, and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores were examined before and after the 4-wk administration of rikkunshito. A subgroup analysis was performed of patients showing a GSRS score of >=  2 before treatment, indicating the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. RESULTS: The patients' body weight increased significantly after the administration of rikkunshito. Neither their appetite nor plasma acylated and deacylated ghrelin levels were significantly affected. In the subgroup analysis, the mean total GSRS score improved significantly from 2.6      0.6 before the administration of rikkunshito to 1.9      0.7 after administration because of the significant improvement in the subscale scores for abdominal pain, acid reflux, diarrhea, and constipation. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term quality of life was well preserved in the patients who had undergone PG at our hospital. In the patients with a baseline GSRS score of >= 2, rikkunshito significantly improved the symptoms of postgastrectomy syndrome, and its effect was possibly independent of the plasma ghrelin levels.

24631952|t|Preventive effect of rikkunshito on gastric motor function inhibited by L-dopa in rats.
24631952|a|We previously reported that ghrelin prevented l-dopa (LD)-induced inhibition of gastric emptying (GE) of a non-nutrient solution in rats. Parkinson's disease treatment involves the combined administration of l-dopa with the enzyme l-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, carbidopa (CD) to reduce peripheral formation of dopamine. We investigated the effect LD/CD given orogastrically (og) on GE of a non-nutrient or nutrient meal and whether og pretreatment with rikkunshito, a kampo medicine clinically used to treat gastroparesis, influenced LD/CD effect on GE and postprandial antral and duodenal motility in conscious rats. LD/CD (20/2 mgkg(-1)) decreased significantly GE to 26.3    6.0% compared to 61.2    3.2% in og vehicle monitored 20-min after a non-nutrient meal and to 41.9    5.8% compared to 72.9    5.2% in og vehicle monitored 60 min after a nutrient meal. Rikkunshito (0.5 or 1.0 g kg(-1)) reduced the LD/CD (20/2 mg kg(-1)) inhibition of GE of non-nutrient meal (36.9    7.4% and 46.6    4.8% respectively vs. 12.1    7.4% in og vehicle plus LD/CD) while having no effect alone (56.6    8.5%). The ghrelin antagonist, [d-Lys(3)]-GHRP-6 (1 mg kg(-1)) injected intraperitoneally partially reversed rikkunshito preventive effect on LD/CD-inhibited GE. Rikkunshito (1.0 g kg(-1)) blocked LD/CD (20/2 mg kg(-1))-induced delayed GE of a nutrient meal and the reduction of postprandial antral motility. In 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinson's disease rat model, rikkunshito (1.0 g kg(-1), og) also prevented LD/CD-inhibited gastric emptying of a nutrient meal and enhanced fasting plasma levels of acylated ghrelin. These data indicate that oral rikkunshito alleviates the delayed GE induced by LD/CD in na  ve and PD rat model in part through ghrelin-related mechanisms.

23907105|t|Intragastric infusion of rikkunshito (kampo) induces proximal stomach relaxation in conscious dogs.
23907105|a|PURPOSE: Abnormal proximal gastric relaxation is one of the causes of functional dyspepsia. The purpose of this study is to use a barostat in conscious dogs to determine the effects of rikkunshito, which is considered to have beneficial effects on functional dyspepsia, on the proximal stomach. METHODS: Eight beagles were used. A gastrocutaneous fistula and force transducers were surgically implanted in the middle corpus and gastric antrum and duodenum, respectively. After a recovery period, a plastic bag was inserted through the gastrocutaneous fistula and the proximal stomach was distended using a barostat. First, four dogs were used to investigate the pressure-volume relation in the fasted and postprandial phases. Second, the stomachs of four different dogs were continuously distended at minimal distending pressure +2 mmHg, and 5 min later were infused with warmed liquid rikkunshito (2 g/20 mL) or water through the gastrocutaneous fistula. Finally, changes in the proximal gastric volume and gastrointestinal motility were observed. RESULTS: The proximal stomach was significantly more pliable in the postprandial phase than in the fasted phase. The proximal gastric volume increased immediately after liquid infusion under constant pressure in both phases and duodenal motility was accelerated. The effect of rikkunshito was significantly greater and lasted longer than that of water. No significant difference between the effects during the fasted or postprandial phase and no change in the gastric antrum motility were observed when rikkunshito was infused. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rikkunshito accelerates duodenal motility and relaxes the proximal stomach.

19697049|t|Impact of rikkunshito, an herbal medicine, on delayed gastric emptying in profoundly handicapped patients.
19697049|a|PURPOSE: Rikkunshito is used to treat functional dyspepsia in adults. This study investigated the effects of rikkunshito on delayed gastric emptying in handicapped patients. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in nine profoundly handicapped patients (aged 1-19 years). All were diagnosed with delayed gastric emptying based on their half gastric emptying time (T(1/2)) over 90 min. Gastric emptying was evaluated after the ingestion of liquid meals using the (13)C-acetate breath test and the BreathID system. Participants were given rikkunshito [0.3 g/(kg day)] with the aim of accelerating gastric emptying. Parameters related to gastric emptying before and during rikkunshito administration were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Data were expressed as the median (range). RESULTS: Emesis and hematemesis were relieved with rikkunshito administration in four symptomatic patients. The T(1/2) and T(lag) decreased significantly during rikkunshito administration from 115 min (94-167 min) to 107 min (64-66 min; p = 0.02), and from 60 min (42-90 min) to 47 min (29-59 min; p = 0.03), respectively. The gastric emptying coefficient did not show a significant change [3.1 (2.8-3.8) vs. 3.2 (2.6-4.0), p = 0.15)] with rikkunshito treatment. CONCLUSION: The administration of rikkunshito resulted in symptomatic relief and improved gastric emptying in profoundly handicapped patients with delayed gastric emptying.

25559780|t|Efficacy of the Japanese herbal medicine rikkunshito in infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
25559780|a|BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants is among the most common reason for physician consultation worldwide. A traditional Japanese medicine, rikkunshito (RKT), is effective for GERD in adult and pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RKT in infants with GERD. METHODS: Fifty-four infants were referred to between July 2004 and December 2012 for evaluation and treatment of GERD. All infants had failure to thrive. We excluded nine patients with cow's milk protein allergy, neurological impairment or surgical indications. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 45 infants with GERD. Twenty-nine infants were treated with RKT (TJ-43; 0.3   g/kg/day; RKT group), and 16 infants were treated with mosapride citrate at 0.5   mg/kg/day (mosapride group). The primary endpoint was RKT-induced relief of clinical symptoms and bodyweight gain in infants with GERD. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, the frequency of vomiting per day was significantly lower in the RKT group than in the mosapride group (P = 0.0146) and the weight Z-score was significantly higher in the RKT group than in the mosapride group (RKT group, -2.5    1.5 vs mosapride group, -5.0    2.0; P = 0.0386). No adverse effects were noted in either group. CONCLUSIONS: RKT may be safe and effective for relief of GER symptoms and for bodyweight gain in infants with GERD.

25688209|t|Clinical application of kampo medicine (rikkunshito) for common and/or intractable symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract.
25688209|a|Gastroenterological reflux disease and functional dyspepsia are usually treatable using Western medical practices. Nonetheless, some cases present with intractable symptoms that are not amenable to these therapies. Treatment with kampo, a traditional Japanese medicine, recently has been proposed as an alternative therapy for use in combination with the Western practices. In general, traditional Japanese medicines have been used empirically for intractable symptoms correctively designated as "general malaises." Accumulating lines of evidence, including basic and clinical researches, have demonstrate detailed mechanisms where traditional Japanese medicines exert pharmacological action to improve symptoms. Therefore, traditional Japanese medicines have been gaining use by various medical doctors as the specific modes of pharmacological action are recognized. This review covers both the pharmacological functions and the clinical efficacies of rikkunshito for use in treating disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.

27644563|t|Efficacy of proton pump inhibitor in combination with rikkunshito in patients complaining of globus pharyngeus.
27644563|a|OBJECTIVE: Globus pharyngeus (GP) is a common symptom of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD), and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine having prokinetic effect improve LPRD symptoms. In the present study, we examined the efficacy of high-dose PPI in combination with rikkunshito in patients complaining of GP. METHODS: 106 patients complaining of GP without any organic endoscopic findings were enrolled. RESULTS: Patients were first administrated with high-dose PPI alone for 4 to 8 weeks and the symptom was improved in 65 patients. Among 41 patients with PPI-refractory GP, 22 patients were administrated with high-dose PPI in combination with rikkunshito, and the symptom was improved in 14 of 22 patients 4 weeks later. The average value of a modified reflux symptom index of the responders was similar to that of non-responders. Only a few patients had positive values in reflux finding scores in both groups. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest the existence of a high prevalence of LPRD in patients complaining of GP. The data also suggest that gastroesophageal dysmotility is involved in GP, in addition to excessive acid reflux. The pre-therapeutic laryngopharyngeal symptoms and endoscopic findings could not predict the efficacy of the treatment for GP. J. Med. Invest. 63: 227-229, August, 2016.

18439428|t|Rikkunshito, an herbal medicine, suppresses cisplatin-induced anorexia in rats via 5-HT2 receptor antagonism.
18439428|a|BACKGROUND _ AIMS: Chemotherapy with an anticancer agent generally causes gastrointestinal tract disorders such as vomiting and anorexia, but the mechanism remains unclear. Rikkunshito, a kampo preparation, is known to alleviate such adverse reactions. In this study, we attempted to clarify the mechanism. METHODS: We investigated the decreases of plasma acylated-ghrelin level and food intake caused by cisplatin, serotonin (5-HT), 5-HT agonists, and vagotomy as well as the decrease-suppressing effects of rikkunshito and 5-HT antagonists. In addition, binding affinities of rikkunshito components were determined in receptor-binding assays using 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors. RESULTS: Cisplatin, 5-HT, BW723C86 (5-HT2B-receptor agonist), and m-chlorophenylpiperazine HCl (5-HT2C agonist) markedly decreased plasma acylated-ghrelin levels, although 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 agonists had no effect. In contrast, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C antagonists suppressed the cisplatin-induced decrease of plasma acylated-ghrelin level and food intake. Administration of rat ghrelin improved the cisplatin-induced decrease in food intake. Vagotomy decreased the plasma acylated-ghrelin level, which was decreased further by cisplatin. Rikkunshito suppressed such cisplatin-induced decreases of plasma acylated-ghrelin level and food intake. The suppressive effect of rikkunshito was blocked by a ghrelin antagonist. Components of rikkunshito, 3,3',4',5,6,7,8-heptamethoxyflavone, hesperidin, and iso-liquiritigenin showed a 5-HT2B-antagonistic effect in vitro, and oral administration of rikkunshito suppressed the cisplatin-induced decrease in the plasma acylated-ghrelin level. CONCLUSIONS: The cisplatin-induced decreases of the plasma acylated-ghrelin level and food intake are mediated by 5-HT2B/2C receptors and suppressed by flavonoids in rikkunshito.

20016992|t|Rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, may relieve abdominal symptoms in rats with experimental esophagitis by improving the barrier function of epithelial cells in esophageal mucosa.
20016992|a|BACKGROUND: A traditional Japanese medicine, rikkunshito, has been reported to relieve dyspepsia symptoms. We investigated the effect of rikkunshito on RE-induced abdominal dyspepsia, and performed experiments to elucidate the mechanism of that effect. METHODS: RE model rats were prepared using 8-week-old male Wistar rats, and rikkunshito was administered in drinking water. Voluntary movement was used as an index of RE-induced abdominal dyspepsia, which was monitored by an infrared sensor. On the tenth day after surgery, the total area of esophageal erosion was measured, and samples of nonerosive mucosa were collected. Using those samples, intercellular spaces of epithelial mucosa were examined by transmission electron microscopy, and the NP-40-soluble and -insoluble levels of the tight junction proteins claudin-1, -3 and -4 and their mRNAs were determined. RESULTS: Rikkunshito did not reduce the average total area of erosive lesions in the esophageal mucosa of RE model rats. On day 10, voluntary movement was significantly decreased in the RE model rats and rikkunshito significantly increased it. Nonerosive esophageal mucosa from RE rats showed dilation of intercellular spaces in epithelium, and significantly decreased claudin-3 mRNA and protein levels. Rikkunshito significantly suppressed intercellular space dilation and significantly increased the level of NP-40-insoluble claudin-3, but it did not affect the mRNA level, suggesting that it promoted tight junction formation by facilitating the translocation of proteins. CONCLUSION: Rikkunshito increased voluntary movement in RE model rats. This may have been because rikkunshito ameliorated the symptoms of RE by improving the barrier function of esophageal mucosa.

26252950|t|Association of baseline plasma des-acyl ghrelin level with the response to rikkunshito in patients with functional dyspepsia.
26252950|a|BACKGROUND AND AIM: We recently conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of rikkunshito, a standardized Japanese herbal medicine, for the treatment of functional dyspepsia (FD). The present post-hoc study aimed to evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics between responders and non-responders among FD patients who received rikkunshito for 8   weeks. METHODS: Rikkunshito responders were defined by using a global patient assessment. Candidate predictors included age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, comorbidity, Helicobacter pylori infection, plasma levels of acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin, severity of dyspeptic symptoms, FD subgroup, previous medication, and the type of recruiting institution (clinic or hospital). We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) by using Cox regression analysis with the factors that were indicated to be associated with responders. RESULTS: We assigned 83 and 42 patients to responder and non-responder categories, respectively. Lack of alcohol consumption (HR, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.88) and low plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels (<   177   fmol/mL; HR, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.73) were significantly associated with the efficacy of rikkunshito. Lack of alcohol consumption was associated with the efficacy of rikkunshito especially among H.   pylori-infected participants. On the other hand, the low plasma des-acyl ghrelin was associated with the efficacy of rikkunshito especially among H.   pylori-negative participants. CONCLUSIONS: A low baseline level of plasma des-acyl ghrelin was associated with an increased treatment efficacy of rikkunshito against FD. Lack of alcohol consumption was also clinically useful for predicting the response to rikkunshito.

25540621|t|Rikkunshito, a ghrelin potentiator, ameliorates anorexia-cachexia syndrome.
25540621|a|Anorexia-cachexia syndrome develops during the advanced stages of various chronic diseases in which patients exhibit a decreased food intake, weight loss, and muscle tissue wasting. For these patients, this syndrome is a critical problem leading to an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. The present pharmacological therapies for treating anorexia-cachexia have limited effectiveness. The Japanese herbal medicine rikkunshito is often prescribed for the treatment of anorexia and upper gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Thus, rikkunshito is expected to be beneficial for the treatment of patients with anorexia-cachexia syndrome. In this review, we summarize the effects of rikkunshito and its mechanisms of action on anorexia-cachexia. Persistent loss of appetite leads to a progressive depletion of body energy stores, which is frequently associated with cachexia. Consequently, regulating appetite and energy homeostasis is critically important for treating cachexia. Ghrelin is mainly secreted from the stomach, and it plays an important role in initiating feeding, controlling GI motility, and regulating energy expenditure. Recent clinical and basic science studies have demonstrated that the critical mechanism of rikkunshito underlies endogenous ghrelin activity. Interestingly, several components of rikkunshito target multiple gastric and central sites, and regulate the secretion, receptor sensitization, and degradation of ghrelin. Rikkunshito is effective for the treatment of anorexia, body weight loss, muscle wasting, and anxiety-related behavior. Furthermore, treatment with rikkunshito was observed to prolong survival in an animal model of cachexia. The use of a potentiator of ghrelin signaling, such as rikkunshito, may represent a novel approach for the treatment of anorexia-cachexia syndrome.

19082653|t|Effect of rikkunshito, a chinese herbal medicine, on stasis in patients after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy.
19082653|a|BACKGROUND: Distal gastrectomy (DG) and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) have been employed for gastric cancer, with PPG having been reported to be superior to DG in regard to postoperative quality of life. Some patients with these operations still suffer from gastric stasis, however. In this study, we aimed to examine the clinical effects of rikkunshito on patients who were to undergo PPG. METHODS: A total of 11 patients who were scheduled to undergo PPG for early gastric cancer at the Osaka University Hospital were enrolled. The patients were randomly assigned to the crossover study with and without rikkunshito 7.5 g/day. Questionnaires and emptying tests using (111)In-labeled liquid scintigraphy and (99m)Tc-labeled solid scintigraphy were performed at the end of each treatment period. RESULTS: Stasis-related symptoms were significantly reduced during rikkunshito treatment (p = 0.043). The emptying test showed that rikkunshito improved emptying of solid meals (p = 0.0003) from the remnant stomach but did not accelerate gastric empting of liquid meals. CONCLUSIONS: Rikkunshito improved gastric emptying and ameliorated postoperative symptoms of patients who had undergone a PPG.

24223626|t|Characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms and function following endoscopic submucosal dissection and treatment of the gastrointestinal symptoms using rikkunshito.
24223626|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and gastric emptying following endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), as well as to evaluate a novel treatment strategy using rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine. GI symptoms and gastric emptying were evaluated 6-8 days after ESD as part of the Step I study. In the Step 1 study, the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores of the two groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment with either a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; PPI monotreatment group, n=5) or a PPI plus rikkunshito (PPI + rikkunshito group, n=8) were compared against baseline values. Abdominal pain and constipation occurred in the majority of patients after ESD. The mean T-max 6-8 days after gastric emptying was 75.4  13.6 min, which was significantly longer compared with that reported in healthy subjects (43.9  10.3 min). In the Step 2 study, the total GSRS score was significantly improved only in the PPI + rikkunshito group after 8 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, ESD affects gastric emptying and is associated with an increased incidence of upper GI symptoms such as abdominal pain and indigestion. Rikkunshito may be useful as a novel supporting therapeutic drug for the treatment of GI symptoms in patients who have undergone ESD.

17668223|t|Effects of rikkunshito on the clinical symptoms and esophageal acid exposure in children with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux.
17668223|a|Rikkunshito (TJ-43), a herbal medicine consisting of eight herbs, is used to treat chronic dyspepsia. Studies have shown that TJ-43 improves human gastric emptying. This study investigated the effects of TJ-43 on the clinical symptoms and esophageal acid exposure in children with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Eight children, aged from 2 months to 15 years (median age 4 years), were studied. Six of them had neurological impairment. TJ-43 (0.3 g/kg/day) was given orally or via nasogastric tubes in three divided doses before meals for 7 days. Their symptoms were frequent emesis in four, nausea in two, and hematemesis and stridor in one each. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring was conducted using multichannel pH electrodes located at the distal esophagus (P1) and 10 cm proximal to P1 (P2). The clinical symptoms and esophageal pH were compared before and after TJ-43 therapy for 1 week. The frequency of emesis decreased in three patients. Other symptoms, including nausea, hematemesis, and stridor, were relieved in the remaining patients. Measured at the distal pH electrode, the percentage time of esophageal pH < 4.0 and the mean duration of reflux decreased significantly (P < 0.05). However, the number of acid reflux per hour did not change significantly, and no pH parameters measured at the proximal electrode differed significantly. The short-term administration of TJ-43 relieved symptoms and reduced the distal esophageal acid exposure through improved esophageal acid clearance.

24712488|t|Effect of rikkunshito on the expression of substance P and CGRP in dorsal root ganglion neurons and voluntary movement in rats with experimental reflux esophagitis.
24712488|a|BACKGROUND: While there are reports that the herbal medicine rikkunshito (RKT) relieves upper gastrointestinal disease symptoms, the effect of RKT on primary afferent neurons is unknown. METHODS: A model of reflux esophagitis (RE) was implemented using male Wistar rats aged 6-7 weeks. Ten days after surgery, the total area of esophageal mucosal erosion sites was determined. Th8-10 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were dissected out and the expression of substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) was determined in DRG using immunohistochemistry. RKT (0.6%/WV) or omeprazole (OME) (10 mg/kg) was administered for 10 days beginning on the day after surgery. Voluntary movement was measured with an infrared sensor for 22 h each day. KEY RESULTS: RE rats showed esophageal mucosal erosion and significantly increased number of SP/CGRP- and p-ERK1/2-immunoreactive neurons in DRG. Treatment with OME improved the size of erosive lesions in the esophageal mucosa of RE rats, while RKT did not. Treatment with RKT or OME significantly reduced the expression of SP/CGRP and p-ERK1/2 in DRG, and significantly increased voluntary movement in RE rats. CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: RKT inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and decreased the expression of SP and CGRP in DRG of RE rats, which may be associated with the observed amelioration of voluntary movement.

25074732|t|Physiological analysis of the effects of rikkunshito on acid and non-acid gastroesophageal reflux using pH-multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring.
25074732|a|PURPOSE: To clarify the effects of rikkunshito on acid reflux, non-acid reflux, and esophageal clearance in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: We enrolled seven patients with vomiting and/or stridor (median 6 years; 1 month-17 years), with a percent total time of esophageal pH <4.0 (reflux index) over 4.0%. Rikkunshito (TJ-43; Tsumura Co, Tokyo, Japan) was given in three divided doses before meals. We retrospectively investigated its efficacy using pH-multichannel intraluminal impedance before and 7 (6-10) days after starting treatment. Statistical analyses were conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: In the pH analyses alone, the median number of acid reflux episodes >5 min (14 versus 10, p = 0.046) and median acid-clearance time (184 versus 134 s, p = 0.03) decreased significantly, although median decrease in reflux index did not reach significance (16.0 versus 17.9%, p = 0.06). In the combined impedance and pH analyses, the median number (36 versus 36, p = 0.03) and median duration (1.9 versus 1.1%, p = 0.046) of acid reflux decreased significantly; non-acid reflux and bolus clearance time did not change. CONCLUSION: Rikkunshito effectively reduced acid reflux, but not esophageal clearance, in patients with GERD.

21846463|t|10-Gingerol, a component of rikkunshito, improves cisplatin-induced anorexia by inhibiting acylated ghrelin degradation.
21846463|a|Rikkunshito (RKT), a Japanese traditional medicine, has been shown to stimulate food intake in rats with cisplatin-induced anorexia; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether RKT is involved in the degradation of peripheral ghrelin. RKT inhibited decreases in plasma ghrelin level and enhanced acyl- to desacyl-ghrelin (A/D) ratio in cisplatin-treated rats. Several components of RKT demonstrated inhibitory activity against ghrelin deacylating enzymes. In addition, 10-gingerol, a component of RKT, inhibited exogenous ghrelin deacylation. Therefore, RKT may enhance plasma acyl-ghrelin level, at least in part, by inhibiting the circulating ghrelin degrading enzyme.

26775072|t|Total gastrectomy-induced reductions in food intake and weight are counteracted by rikkunshito by attenuating glucagon-like peptide-1 elevation in rats.
26775072|a|BACKGROUND: Decrease in appetite and weight after total gastrectomy in patients with gastric cancer leads to a decrease in quality of life, increased mortality, and may necessitate discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to determine whether rikkunshito, a Japanese herbal medicine, increases food intake and weight after gastrectomy in rats. METHODS: Male rats underwent gastrectomy followed by roux-en-Y reconstruction or sham operation and were then treated with rikkunshito for 14  days starting on postoperative day 3. Daily food intake, weight, plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and ghrelin levels were measured. A pilot study to measure pre- and postoperative plasma GLP-1 levels was conducted in patients who underwent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. RESULTS: Administration of rikkunshito after gastrectomy in rats significantly increased food intake and weight, which continued for at least 2 weeks after treatment. Both fasting and postprandial plasma GLP-1 levels were increased markedly after gastrectomy compared with sham-operated animals. Increased GLP-1 levels in rats after gastrectomy were suppressed markedly by rikkunshito. rikkunshito had no significant effect on plasma ghrelin levels after gastrectomy. Treatment with a GLP-1 receptor antagonist significantly improved food intake and weight after gastrectomy. Plasma fasting GLP-1 levels in patients with gastric cancer were increased greatly after gastrectomy on postoperative day  1. CONCLUSION: Administration of rikkunshito suppresses plasma GLP-1 levels after total gastrectomy, which is associated with recovery from reduced food intake and weight in rats.

26191003|t|Identification of Glycyrrhiza as the rikkunshito constituent with the highest antagonistic potential on heterologously expressed 5-HT3A receptors due to the action of flavonoids.
26191003|a|The traditional Japanese phytomedicine rikkunshito is traditionally used for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders, cachexia and nausea. These effects indicate 5-HT3 receptor antagonism, due to the involvement of these receptors in such pathophysiological processes. E.g., setrons, specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are the strongest antiemetics, developed so far. Therefore, the antagonistic effects of the eight rikkunshito constituents at heterologously expressed 5-HT3Areceptors were analyzed using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. The results indicate that tinctures from Aurantii, Ginseng, Zingiberis, Atractylodis and Glycyrrhiza inhibited the 5-HT3A receptor response, whereas the tinctures of Poria cocos, Jujubae and Pinellia exhibited no effect. Surprisingly, the strongest antagonism was found for Glycyrrhiza, whereas the Zingiberis tincture, which is considered to be primarily responsible for the effect of rikkunshito, exhibited the weakest antagonism of 5-HT3A receptors. Rikkunshito contains various vanilloids, ginsenosides and flavonoids, a portion of which show an antagonistic effect on 5-HT3 receptors. A screening of the established ingredients of the active rikkunshito constituents and related substances lead to the identification of new antagonists within the class of flavonoids. The flavonoids (-)-liquiritigenin, glabridin and licochalcone A from Glycyrrhiza species were found to be the most effective inhibitors of the 5-HT-induced currents in the screening. The flavonoids (-)-liquiritigenin and hesperetin from Aurantii inhibited the receptor response in a non-competitive manner, whereas glabridin and licochalcone A exhibited a potential competitive antagonism. Furthermore, licochalcone A acts as a partial antagonist of 5-HT3A receptors. Thus, this study reveals new 5-HT3A receptor antagonists with the aid of increasing the comprehension of the complex effects of rikkunshito.

27273195|t|CRF receptor 1 antagonism and brain distribution of active components contribute to the ameliorative effect of rikkunshito on stress-induced anorexia.
27273195|a|Rikkunshito (RKT), a Kampo medicine, has been reported to show an ameliorative effect on sustained hypophagia after novelty stress exposure in aged mice through serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) antagonism. We aimed to determine (1) whether the activation of anorexigenic neurons, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, is involved in the initiation of hypophagia induced by novelty stress in aged mice; (2) whether the ameliorative effect of RKT is associated with CRF and POMC neurons and downstream signal transduction; and (3) the plasma and brain distribution of the active components of RKT. The administration of RKT or 5-HT2CR, CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1), and melanocortin-4 receptor antagonists significantly restored the decreased food intake observed in aged male C57BL/6 mice in the early stage after novelty stress exposure. Seven components of RKT exhibited antagonistic activity against CRFR1. Hesperetin and isoliquiritigenin, which showed antagonistic effects against both CRFR1 and 5-HT2CR, were distributed in the plasma and brain of male Sprague-Dawley rats after a single oral administration of RKT. In conclusion, the ameliorative effect of RKT in this model is assumed to be at least partly due to brain-distributed active components possessing 5-HT2CR and CRFR1 antagonistic activities.

26088415|t|Ghrelin enhancer, rikkunshito, improves postprandial gastric motor dysfunction in an experimental stress model.
26088415|a|BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia (FD) is one of the most common disorders of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. However, no curable treatment is available for FD because the detailed mechanism of GI dysfunction in stressed conditions remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the association between endogenous acylated ghrelin signaling and gastric motor dysfunction and explore the possibility of a drug with ghrelin signal-enhancing action for FD treatment. METHODS: Solid gastric emptying (GE) and plasma acylated ghrelin levels were evaluated in an urocortin1 (UCN1) -induced stress model. To clarify the role of acylated ghrelin on GI dysfunction in the model, exogenous acylated ghrelin, an endogenous ghrelin enhancer, rikkunshito, or an a2 -adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist was administered. Postprandial motor function was investigated using a strain gauge force transducer in a free-moving condition. KEY RESULTS: Exogenous acylated ghrelin supplementation restored UCN1-induced delayed GE. Alpha2 -AR antagonist and rikkunshito inhibited the reduction in plasma acylated ghrelin and GE in the stress model. The action of rikkunshito on delayed GE was blocked by co-administration of the ghrelin receptor antagonist. UCN1 decreased the amplitude of contraction in the antrum while increasing it in the duodenum. The motility index of the antrum but not the duodenum was significantly reduced by UCN1 treatment, which was improved by acylated ghrelin or rikkunshito. CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: The UCN1-induced gastric motility dysfunction was mediated by abnormal acylated ghrelin dynamics. Supplementation of exogenous acylated ghrelin or enhancement of endogenous acylated ghrelin secretion by rikkunshito may be effective in treating functional GI disorders.

24535455|t|A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial of rikkunshito for patients with non-erosive reflux disease refractory to proton-pump inhibitor: the G-PRIDE study.
24535455|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of rikkunshito (RKT), a traditional Japanese medicine, combined with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in patients with PPI-refractory non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). METHODS: Patients with PPI-refractory NERD (n  =  242) were randomly assigned to the RKT group [rabeprazole (10  mg/day)  +  RKT (7.5  g/t.i.d.) for 8  weeks] or the placebo group (rabeprazole  +  placebo). After the 4- and 8-week treatments, we assessed symptoms and quality of life (QOL) using the Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (FSSG), Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), and Short-Form Health Survey-8 (SF-8). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in FSSG and GSRS score improvement between these groups after the 4- and 8-week treatments. The mental component summary (MCS) scores of the SF-8 improved more in the RKT group (from 45.8      8.1 to 48.5      7.4) than in the placebo group (from 47.7      7.1 to 48.4      7.5) after the 4-week treatment (P  <  0.05). The 8-week treatment with RKT was more effective for improvement of the degree of MCS score in patients with a low body mass index (<22) (P  <  0.05) and significantly improved the acid-related dysmotility symptoms of FSSG in female and elderly patients (>= 65  years). CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in improvement of GERD symptoms in patients with PPI-refractory NERD between these groups. However, RKT may be useful for improving mental QOL in non-obese patients and acid-related dyspeptic symptoms, especially in women and the elderly.

24684160|t|Administration of exogenous acylated ghrelin or rikkunshito, an endogenous ghrelin enhancer, improves the decrease in postprandial gastric motility in an acute restraint stress mouse model.
24684160|a|BACKGROUND: Physical or psychological stress causes functional disorders in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This study aims to elucidate the ameliorating effect of exogenous acylated ghrelin or rikkunshito, a Kampo medicine which acts as a ghrelin enhancer, on gastric dysfunction during acute restraint stress in mice. METHODS: Fasted and postprandial motor function of the gastric antrum was wirelessly measured using a strain gauge force transducer and solid gastric emptying was detected in mice exposed to restraint stress. Plasma corticosterone and ghrelin levels were also measured. To clarify the role of ghrelin on gastrointestinal dysfunction in mice exposed to stress, exogenous acylated ghrelin or rikkunshito was administered, then the mice were subjected to restraint stress. KEY RESULTS: Mice exposed to restraint stress for 60  min exhibited delayed gastric emptying and increased plasma corticosterone levels. Gastric motility was decreased in mice exposed to restraint stress in both fasting and postprandial states. Restraint stress did not cause any change in plasma acylated ghrelin levels, but it significantly increased the plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels. Administration of acylated ghrelin or rikkunshito improved the restraint stress-induced delayed gastric emptying and decreased antral motility. Ameliorating effects of rikkunshito on stress-induced gastric dysfunction were abolished by simultaneous administration of a ghrelin receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: Plasma acylated/des-acyl ghrelin imbalance was observed in acute restraint stress. Supplementation of exogenous acylated ghrelin or enhancement of endogenous ghrelin signaling may be useful in the treatment of decreased gastric function caused by stress.

24990161|t|Clinical characteristics of elderly patients with proton pump inhibitor-refractory non-erosive reflux disease from the G-PRIDE study who responded to rikkunshito.
24990161|a|BACKGROUND: The incidence and severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in Japan tends to increase in elderly women. Rikkunshito (RKT), a traditional Japanese medicine, acts as a prokinetic agent and improves gastric emptying and gastric accommodation. Our previous prospective randomized placebo-controlled study showed that RKT combined with a standard-dose of rabeprazole (RPZ) significantly improved the acid-related dysmotility symptoms (ARD) in elderly patients with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). This study aimed to evaluate clinical characteristics of elderly PPI-refractory NERD patients with ARD symptoms who responded to RKT. METHODS: Two hundred forty-two patients with PPI-refractory NERD were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of either RPZ (10 mg/q.d.)   +   RKT (7.5 g/t.i.d.) (RKT group) or RPZ   + placebo (PL group). Among them, 95 were elderly (>= 65 years) with ARD (RKT group: n = 52; PL group: n = 43). We analyzed the changes using the 12 subscale score of frequency scale for the symptoms of GERD (FSSG) and 15 items of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at 4 and 8 weeks and compared the therapeutic efficacy between the 2 groups. RESULTS: There were no marked differences in baseline demographic or clinical characteristics in the 2 groups except for rate of current smoking. The FSSG score (mean    SD at 0, 4, and 8 weeks) in both the RKT (16.0    7.0; 9.9    8.4; 7.0    6.4) and PL (15.1    6.4; 10.9    6.7, 11.1    8.5) groups significantly decreased after treatment. However, the degree of improvement of total and ARD scores of FSSG after the 8-week treatment was significantly greater in the RKT group than in the PL group. Combination therapy with RKT for 8 weeks showed significant improvement in 3 subscale scores (abdominal bloating, heavy feeling in stomach and sick feeling after meals) of the ARD domain and 1 subscale score (heartburn after meals) of the reflux symptom domain. CONCLUSIONS: RKT may be useful for improving GERD symptoms in elderly PPI-refractory NERD patients with ARD. Thus, RKT was particularly effective for resolving postprandial GERD symptoms (heavy feeling in stomach, sick feeling, and heartburn after meals). TRIAL REGISTRATION: (UMIN000005880).

22081052|t|Rikkunshito improves symptoms in PPI-refractory GERD patients: a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial in Japan.
22081052|a|BACKGROUND: To seek a promising therapeutic regimen for proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after the standard PPI treatment, we compared the efficacies of rikkunshito (a Japanese traditional medication) combined with rabeprazole (RPZ) and a double dose of RPZ in a prospective randomized multicenter trial in Japanese PPI-refractory GERD patients. METHODS: One hundred and four patients with GERD symptoms remaining after 4-week treatment with RPZ (10 mg/day) were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of either combination therapy [rikkunshito (7.5 g/day) with a standard dose of RPZ (10 mg/day)] or a double dose of RPZ (20 mg/day). The primary endpoint was the improvement rate, calculated based on the frequency scale for the symptoms of GERD (FSSG) before and after treatment. Subgroup analysis was also performed with respect to each subject's background factors such as reflux esophagitis (RE)/non-erosive GERD (NERD), age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Four-week treatment with rikkunshito combined with RPZ significantly decreased the FSSG score from 17.6    6.5 to 12.0    6.9, similar to the decrease seen on treatment with a double dose of RPZ. Regarding the therapeutic improvement rate, there were also significant effects in both groups. However, in the subgroup analysis based on RE/NERD, the improvement rate of male NERD patients in the rikkunshito group was significantly greater than that of such patients in the other group (P < 0.05). In the rikkunshito group, the treatment was more effective in NERD patients with a low BMI than in those with a high BMI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Rikkunshito combined with standard-dose RPZ therapy may be a useful new strategy for PPI-refractory GERD patients.

24447839|t|Effects of Kampo on functional gastrointestinal disorders.
24447839|a|This article reviews the effectiveness of Kampo (traditional Japanese herbal medicine) in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders, especially functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The results of four randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) suggested the usefulness of rikkunshito in relieving the subjective symptoms of patients with FD. Rikkunshito significantly improved not only gastric symptoms, such as epigastiric discomfort, but also extra-gastric symptoms, such as general fatigue, when compared with control drugs. The therapeutic effects of rikkunshito were more evident when it was prescribed to patients with "kyosho", i.e., low energy. Two RCTs suggested the efficacy of keishikashakuyakuto for IBS.Basic research studies have demonstrated that these Kampo medicines have multiple sites of action to improve subjective symptoms. For example, rikkunshito improves gastric motility dysfunction, including impaired adaptive relaxation and delayed gastric emptying, gastric hypersensitivity, and anorexia via facilitation of ghrelin secretion. It also exhibits anti-stress effects, i.e., it attenuates stress-induced exacerbation of gastric sensation and anorexia, as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and sympathetic activation. Keishikashakuyakuto exhibited not only an antispasmodic effect on intestinal smooth muscle, but also antidepressant-like effects. Case series suggest that other Kampo prescriptions are also effective for FD and IBS. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate their efficacy.

19906817|t|Rikkunshito ameliorates the aging-associated decrease in ghrelin receptor reactivity via phosphodiesterase III inhibition.
19906817|a|Aging is associated with decreased food intake, a phenomenon termed the anorexia of aging. In this study, we sought to clarify changes in peripheral and central appetite-related factors in aged mice. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, on age-related anorexia. C57BL/6J mice that were 6 or 75 wk old were studied. We investigated changes in food intake, ghrelin and leptin levels, and the expression of appetite-related genes with age. In addition, we verified the effects of ghrelin, rikkunshito, phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors on appetite. Food intake was significantly decreased in 75-wk-old mice compared with the 6-wk-old mice. In 75-wk-old mice, plasma acylated ghrelin levels under fasting conditions were lower than in 6-wk-old mice, whereas leptin levels under feeding conditions were substantially higher. The expression levels of hypothalamic preproghrelin under feeding conditions and the expression levels of neuropeptide Y and agouti-related protein under fasting conditions were lower compared with those of the 6-wk-old mice. Ghrelin supplementation (33 microg/kg) failed to increase food intake in 75-wk-old mice. Conversely, oral administration of LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, and cilostamide, a PDE3 inhibitor, increased food intake in 75-wk-old mice. Moreover, rikkunshito increased food intake in aged mice. The components of rikkunshito (nobiletin, isoliquiritigenin, and heptamethoxyflavone) had inhibitory effects on PDE3. These results suggest that dysregulation of ghrelin secretion and ghrelin resistance in the appetite control system occurred in aged mice and that rikkunshito ameliorated aging-associated anorexia via inhibition of PDE3.

20534732|t|Reduced ghrelin secretion in the hypothalamus of rats due to cisplatin-induced anorexia.
20534732|a|Although chemotherapy with cisplatin is a widely used and effective cancer treatment, the undesirable gastrointestinal side effects associated with it, such as nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, markedly decrease patients' quality of life. To elucidate the mechanism underlying chemotherapy-induced anorexia, focusing on the hypothalamic ghrelin secretion-anorexia association, we measured hypothalamic ghrelin secretion in fasted and cisplatin-treated rats. Hypothalamic ghrelin secretion changes after vagotomy or administration of cisplatin. Cisplatin + rikkunshito, a serotonin 2C receptor antagonist or serotonin 3 receptor antagonist, was investigated. The effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of ghrelin or the serotonin 2C receptor antagonist SB242084 on food intake were also evaluated in cisplatin-treated rats. Hypothalamic ghrelin secretion significantly increased in 24-h-fasted rats compared to freely fed rats and was markedly reduced 24 and 48 h after cisplatin treatment in cisplatin-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats, although their plasma ghrelin levels were comparable. In cisplatin-treated rats, icv ghrelin administration reversed the decrease in food intake, vagotomy partially restored hypothalamic ghrelin secretion, and hypothalamic serotonin 2C receptor mRNA expression increased significantly. Administration of rikkunshito (an endogenous ghrelin enhancer) or a serotonin 2C receptor antagonist reversed the decrease in hypothalamic ghrelin secretion and food intake 24 h after cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin-induced anorexia is mediated through reduced hypothalamic ghrelin secretion. Cerebral serotonin 2C receptor activation partially induces decrease in hypothalamic ghrelin secretion, and rikkunshito suppresses cisplatin-induced anorexia by enhancing this secretion.

26830139|t|Increased ghrelin signaling prolongs survival in mouse models of human aging through activation of sirtuin1.
26830139|a|UNASSIGNED: Caloric restriction (CR) is known to retard aging and delay functional decline as well as the onset of diseases in most organisms. Ghrelin is secreted from the stomach in response to CR and regulates energy metabolism. We hypothesized that in CR ghrelin has a role in protecting aging-related diseases. We examined the physiological mechanisms underlying the ghrelin system during the aging process in three mouse strains with different genetic and biochemical backgrounds as animal models of accelerated or normal human aging. The elevated plasma ghrelin concentration was observed in both klotho-deficient and senescence-accelerated mouse prone/8 (SAMP8) mice. Ghrelin treatment failed to stimulate appetite and prolong survival in klotho-deficient mice, suggesting the existence of ghrelin resistance in the process of aging. However, ghrelin antagonist hastened death and ghrelin signaling potentiators rikkunshito and atractylodin ameliorated several age-related diseases with decreased microglial activation in the brain and prolonged survival in klotho-deficient, SAMP8 and aged ICR mice. In vitro experiments, the elevated sirtuin1 (SIRT1) activity and protein expression through the cAMP-CREB pathway was observed after ghrelin and ghrelin potentiator treatment in ghrelin receptor 1a-expressing cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, rikkunshito increased hypothalamic SIRT1 activity and SIRT1 protein expression of the heart in the all three mouse models of aging. Pericarditis, myocardial calcification and atrophy of myocardial and muscle fiber were improved by treatment with rikkunshito. Ghrelin signaling may represent one of the mechanisms activated by CR, and potentiating ghrelin signaling may be useful to extend health and lifespan.

24347053|t|New cancer cachexia rat model generated by implantation of a peritoneal dissemination-derived human stomach cancer cell line.
24347053|a|Cancer cachexia (CC), a syndrome characterized by anorexia and body weight loss due to low fat-free mass levels, including reduced musculature, markedly worsens patient quality of life. Although stomach cancer patients have the highest incidence of cachexia, few experimental models for the study of stomach CC have been established. Herein, we developed stomach CC animal models using nude rats subcutaneously implanted with two novel cell lines, i.e., MKN45c185, established from the human stomach cancer cell line MKN-45, and 85As2, derived from peritoneal dissemination of orthotopically implanted MKN45c185 cells in mice. Both CC models showed marked weight loss, anorexia, reduced musculature and muscle strength, increased inflammatory markers, and low plasma albumin levels; however, CC developed earlier and was more severe in rats implanted with 85As2 than in those implanted with MKN45cl85. Moreover, human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a known cachectic factor, and hypothalamic orexigenic peptide mRNA levels increased in the models, whereas hypothalamic anorexigenic peptide mRNA levels decreased. Surgical removal of the tumor not only abolished cachexia symptoms but also reduced plasma LIF levels to below detectable limits. Importantly, oral administration of rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, substantially ameliorated CC-related anorexia and body composition changes. In summary, our novel peritoneal dissemination-derived 85As2 rat model developed severe cachexia, possibly caused by LIF from cancer cells, that was ameliorated by rikkunshito. This model should provide a useful tool for further study into the mechanisms and treatment of stomach CC.

23583320|t|Serotonin 2C receptor antagonism ameliorates novelty-induced hypophagia in aged mice.
23583320|a|This study was conducted to clarify the role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) signaling during novelty-induced hypophagia in aged mice. Male C57BL/6J mice [6-week-old (young) and 79-80-week-old (aged) mice] were exposed to a novel environment, and its effects on feeding behavior, stress hormones, and appetite-related factors were examined. Exposure of aged mice to a novel environment suppressed food intake and increased corticosterone secretion. These responses were marked compared with those in young mice. The expression in hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), pituitary CRF1R and proopiomelanocortin mRNA in aged mice exposed to a novel environment was increased or tended to increase, compared to control mice. 5-HT2CR antagonist, SB242084 or rikkunshito administration attenuated the decrease in food intake and increased stress hormone levels in aged mice exposed to the environmental change. The 5-HT2CR mRNA expression in paraventricular nucleus was significantly enhanced, when aged mice was exposure to the novel environment. Thus, novelty-induced hypophagia in aged mice resulted, at least in part, from up-regulated hypothalamic 5-HT2CR function. In conclusion, 5-HT2CR signaling enhancement and the subsequent activation of the CRF neuron were involved in novelty-induced hypophagia in aged mice, and the 5-HT2CR antagonists offer a promising therapeutic option for depression.

23601430|t|Cisplatin-induced anorexia and ghrelin.
23601430|a|Cisplatin, a formidable anticancer treatment, is used for several varieties of cancer. There are, however, many cases in which treatment must be abandoned due to a decrease in the patient's quality of life from loss of appetite associated with vomiting and nausea. There is a moderate degree of improvement in prevention of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting when serotonin (5-HT) 3 receptor antagonists, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, and steroids-either alone or in combination-are administered. The mechanism of action for anorexia, which continues during or after treatment, is, however, still unclear. This anorexia is, similar to the onset of vomiting and nausea, caused by the action of large amounts of 5-HT released as a result of cisplatin administration on tissue 5-HT receptors. Among the 5-HT receptors, the activation of 5-HT2b and 5-HT2c receptors, in particular, seems to play a major role in cisplatin-induced anorexia. Following activation of these two receptors, there is reduced gastric and hypothalamic secretion of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin. There is ample evidence of the usefulness of exogenous ghrelin, synthetic ghrelin agonists, and the endogenous ghrelin signal-enhancer rikkunshito, which are expected to play significant roles in the clinical treatment and prevention of anorexia in future.

24288687|t|Rikkunshito, a Japanese kampo medicine, ameliorates decreased feeding behavior via ghrelin and serotonin 2B receptor signaling in a novelty stress murine model.
24288687|a|We investigated the effects of rikkunshito (RKT), a ghrelin signal enhancer, on the decrease in food intake after exposure to novelty stress in mice. RKT administration (500   mg/kg, per os) improved the decrease in 6   h cumulative food intake. In control mice, the plasma acylated ghrelin levels significantly increased by 24   h fasting. In contrast, the acylated ghrelin levels did not increase by fasting in mice exposed to the novelty stress. RKT administration to the novelty stress mice showed a significant increase in the acylated ghrelin levels compared with that in the distilled-water-treated control mice. Food intake after administering serotonin 2B (5-HT(2B)) receptor antagonists was evaluated to clarify the role of 5-HT(2B) receptor activation in the decrease in feeding behavior after novelty stress. SB215505 and SB204741, 5-HT(2B) receptor antagonists, significantly improved the decrease in food intake after exposure to novelty stress. A component of RKT, isoliquiritigenin, prevented the decrease in 6   h cumulative food intake. Isoliquiritigenin showed 5-HT(2B) receptor antagonistic activity in vitro. In conclusion, the results suggested that RKT improves the decrease in food intake after novelty stress probably via 5-HT(2B) receptor antagonism of isoliquiritigenin contained in RKT.

21129542|t|Physiological and clinical characteristics of gastroesophageal reflux after congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair.
21129542|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is an important sequela of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair. This study investigated the physiological and clinical characteristics of GER in CDH survivors. METHODS: A total of 52 CDH survivors were investigated retrospectively. Esophageal acid exposure was evaluated with 24-h esophageal pH monitoring in all patients, and esophageal anatomical and motor functional abnormalities were examined with videomanometry in 16 patients. RESULTS: Fundoplication was necessary in 1 patient. Medical treatment with acid suppression or rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine, was successful in nine patients, and the reflux symptoms were ameliorated at the age of 3 years. The percentage of total time the esophageal pH was below 4.0 (reflux index: RI) ranged from 0.1 to 44.3%. No patient with an RI < 10% had reflux symptoms requiring treatment. The basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone ranged from 15 to 35 mmHg (median 25 mmHg). Esophageal peristalsis was preserved in all of the patients examined, except one who had failed peristalsis and poor clearance in the dilated esophagus. CONCLUSION: The motor function of the esophageal body and LES is usually preserved in CDH survivors despite the wide range of esophageal acid exposure in early infancy. Those with symptomatic GER outgrow it, unless associated with advanced respiratory distress or neurological impairment.

26451159|t|Rikkunshito Ameliorates Cancer Cachexia Partly through Elevation of Glucarate in Plasma.
26451159|a|Cancer cachexia, which is characterized by decreased food intake, weight loss and systemic inflammation, increases patient's morbidity and mortality. We previously showed that rikkunshito (RKT), a Japanese traditional herbal medicine (Kampo), ameliorated the symptoms of cancer cachexia through ghrelin signaling-dependent and independent pathways. To investigate other mechanisms of RKT action in cancer cachexia, we performed metabolome analysis of plasma in a rat model bearing the Yoshida AH-130 hepatoma. A total of 110 metabolites were detected in plasma and RKT treatment significantly altered levels of 23 of those metabolites in cachexia model rats. Among them, glucarate, which is known to have anticarcinogenic activity through detoxification of carcinogens via inhibition of b-glucuronidase, was increased in plasma following administration of RKT. In our AH-130 ascites-induced cachexia rat model, administration of glucarate delayed onset of weight loss, improved muscle atrophy, and reduced ascites content. Additionally, glucarate reduced levels of plasma interferon-y (IFN-y) in tumor-bearing rats and was also found to suppress LPS-induced IFN-y expression in splenocytes in vitro. These results suggest that glucarate has anti-inflammatory activity via a direct effect on immune host cells and suggest that RKT may also ameliorate inflammation partly through the elevation of glucarate in plasma.

23737606|t|Cancer cachexia pathophysiology and translational aspect of herbal medicine.
23737606|a|About half of all cancer patients show a syndrome of cachexia, characterized by anorexia and loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle mass. Numerous cytokines have been postulated to play a role in the etiology of cancer cachexia. Cytokines can elicit effects that mimic leptin signaling and suppress orexigenic ghrelin and neuropeptide Y signaling, inducing sustained anorexia and cachexia not accompanied by the usual compensatory response. Furthermore, cytokines have been implicated in the induction of cancer-related muscle wasting. In particular, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma have been implicated in the induction of cancer-related muscle wasting. Cytokine-induced skeletal muscle wasting is probably a multifactorial process, which involves a depression in protein synthesis, an increase in protein degradation or a combination of both. Cancer patients suffer from the reduction in physical function, tolerance to anti-cancer therapy and survival, while many effective chemotherapeutic agents for cancer are burdened by toxicities that can reduce patient's quality of life or hinder their effective use. Herbal medicines have been widely used to help improve such conditions. Recent studies have shown that herbal medicines such as rikkunshito enhance ghrelin signaling and consequently improve nausea, appetite loss and cachexia associated with cancer or cancer chemotherapy, which worsens the quality of life and life expectancy of the patients. The multicomponent herbal medicines capable of targeting multiple sites could be useful for future drug discovery. Mechanistic studies and identification of active compounds could lead to new discoveries in biological and biomedical sciences.

21129548|t|Should fundoplication be added at the time of gastrostomy placement in patients who are neurologically impaired?
21129548|a|BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Patients who have advanced neurologic impairment (NI) and require gastrostomy placement (GP) frequently have symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. We investigated the outcomes of GP without fundoplication in patients who had NI. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 54 patients with NI (median, 7 years; range, 1-18 years) undergoing GP alone. The operative criteria included medically controllable or no reflux symptoms. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the percentage of total esophageal time with a pH less than 4.0 (reflux index, or RI): group I (GI, n = 33), RI less than 5.0% (median age, 6 years; range, 2-15 years); group II (GII, n = 21), RI 5.0% or greater (median age, 10 years; range, 1-18 years). Data are expressed as medians and ranges. RESULTS: Nutritional management was successfully conducted after GP with or without the administration of lansoprazole, famotidine, or rikkunshito in all but 2 patients. One GI patient with alpha-thalassemia required fundoplication, and one GII patient with Cockayne syndrome required gastrojejunal tube feeding. The RI increased significantly in GI patients (2.1% [0%-4.8%] vs 4.5% [0.2%-11.4%], P = .004), whereas it decreased significantly in GII patients (11.2% [5.9%-41.6%] vs 9.8% [1.05-26.6%], P = .04). CONCLUSION: Gastroesophageal reflux and related symptoms rarely deteriorate to require additional treatment after GP in patients with NI. Gastrostomy placement is a less invasive and effective procedure for improving the quality of life in those patients.

20171995|t|Rikkunshito and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist improve cisplatin-induced anorexia via hypothalamic ghrelin interaction.
20171995|a|Circulating ghrelin concentration regulates appetite behavior, but no study thus far has focused on the role of central ghrelin in anorexia after chemotherapy. To clarify the action mechanisms of rikkunshito (RKT), a traditional Japanese medicine, on cisplatin-induced anorexia, we attempted to elucidate its effect on hypothalamic ghrelin receptor expression in cisplatin-induced anorexia. We first examined the effects of an intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of exogenous ghrelin on food intake with or without cisplatin treatment, and the effects of cisplatin or m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a 5-HT2C receptor agonist, on hypothalamic growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHS-R1a) mRNA expression. To identify the mechanism of cisplatin-induced decrease in hypothalamic GHS-R1a mRNA expression, we evaluated the effects of SB242084HCl, a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, and RKT on hypothalamic GHS-R1a gene expression, along with the effect of coadministration of a GHS-R1a antagonist on decreased food intake. Compared to vehicle controls, an ICV-injected rat ghrelin failed to inhibit the decrease in food intake in cisplatin-treated rats. Hypothalamic GHS-R1a gene expression was significantly reduced after cisplatin or mCPP treatment, and the induced decrease was reversed by SB242084HCl or RKT, but not granisetron or ondansetron, both of which are 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Their suppressive effect on the decrease in food intake was abolished by coadministration of the GHS-R1a antagonist. Administration of RKT or SB242084HCl reversed the decrease in food intake induced by mCPP injection. The improvement by RKT on decreased food intake after cisplatin treatment was partly mediated by hesperidin and isoliquiritigenin, components of RKT. Cisplatin-induced anorexia may worsen because of decreased hypothalamic GHS-R1a gene expression. A 5-HT2C receptor antagonist and RKT suppressed cisplatin-induced anorexia by inhibiting reduction of GHS-R1a signal transduction in the hypothalamus.

20450445|t|Evolving drugs in gastroesophageal reflux disease: pharmacologic treatment beyond proton pump inhibitors.
20450445|a|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Despite the clinical success of proton pump inhibitors to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for the majority of patients in both gastroenterology and primary care clinics there is still a substantial group of patients (up to 40% in some studies) who do not completely respond symptomatically to a standard dose of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Specific explanations for these PPI noncomplete responders included transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs), sensitivity to weakly acidic and/or alkaline reflux, large volume of reflux and esophageal hypersensitivity. There is a clear need for GERD therapies beyond the PPIs. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: These drug classes include the GABA(B) receptor agonists (including lesogaberan and arbaclofen placarbil), mGluR5 receptor antagonists, P-CABs, cholecystokinin(2) antagonists and add-on therapies to PPIs including mosapride and rikkunshito. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Both physicians and patients are eagerly awaiting the development and FDA approval of a new class of anti-GERD medications targeting distinct mechanisms. This article provides information on pharmacologic strategies, clinical trials and side-effect profiles on several of the most promising and heavily researched compounds being developed today for the treatment of GERD symptoms and inflammation. Hopefully, this important research will help a large group of PPI noncomplete responding patients receive symptomatic relief and reduce esophageal inflammation through a unique pharmacologic mechanism in the near future. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The treatment of GERD has greatly improved with the PPI class of therapy. Despite excellent success, there is a sizeable population of patients who do not have adequate response to therapies directed only at acid suppression. Emerging new pharmacologic treatment options show promise in further advancing the treatment success of GERD.

21540451|t|Urocortin 1 reduces food intake and ghrelin secretion via CRF(2) receptors.
21540451|a|Although it is known that urocortin 1 (UCN) acts on both corticotropin-releasing factor receptors (CRF(1) and CRF(2)), the mechanisms underlying UCN-induced anorexia remain unclear. In contrast, ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, stimulates food intake. In the present study, we examined the effects of CRF(1) and CRF(2) receptor antagonists (CRF(1)a and CRF(2)a) on ghrelin secretion and synthesis, c-fos mRNA expression in the caudal brain stem, and food intake following intracerebroventricular administration of UCN. Eight-week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats were used after 24-h food deprivation. Acylated and des-acylated ghrelin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA expressions of preproghrelin and c-fos were measured by real-time RT-PCR. The present study provided the following important insights into the mechanisms underlying the anorectic effects of UCN: 1) UCN increased acylated and des-acylated ghrelin levels in the gastric body and decreased their levels in the plasma; 2) UCN decreased preproghrelin mRNA levels in the gastric body; 3) UCN-induced reduction of plasma ghrelin and food intake were restored by CRF(2)a but not CRF(1)a; 4) UCN-induced increase of c-fos mRNA levels in the caudal brain stem containing the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) was inhibited by CRF(2)a; and 5) UCN-induced reduction of food intake was restored by exogenous ghrelin and rikkunshito, an endogenous ghrelin secretion regulator. Thus, UCN increases neuronal activation in the caudal brain stem containing NTS via CRF(2) receptors, which may be related to UCN-induced inhibition of both ghrelin secretion and food intake.

21712530|t|Decreased plasma ghrelin contributes to anorexia following novelty stress.
21712530|a|We hypothesized that anorexia induced by novelty stress caused by exposure to a novel environment may be due to activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and subsequently mediated by decreasing peripheral ghrelin concentration via serotonin (5-HT) and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4R). Each mouse was transferred from group-housed cages to individual cages to establish the novelty stress. We observed the effect of changes in feeding behavior in a novel environment using the method of transferring group-housed mice to individual cages. We investigated the effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of antagonists/agonists of CRF1/2 receptors (CRF1/2Rs), 5-HT(1B)/(2C) receptors (5-HT(1B)/(2C)R), and MC4R to clarify the role of each receptor on the decrease in food intake. Plasma ghrelin levels were also measured. The novelty stress caused a reduction in food intake that was abolished by administering a CRF1R antagonist. Three hours after the novelty stress, appetite reduction was associated with reduced levels of neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide mRNA, increased levels of proopiomelanocortin mRNA in the hypothalamus, and a decrease in plasma ghrelin level. Administering a CRF1R antagonist, a 5-HT(1B)/(2C)R antagonist, an MC4R antagonist, exogenous ghrelin, and an enhancer of ghrelin secretion, rikkunshito, resolved the reduction in food intake 3 h after the novelty stress by enhancing circulating ghrelin concentrations. We showed that anorexia during a novelty stress is a process in which CRF1R is activated at the early stage of appetite loss and is subsequently activated by a 5-HT(1B)/(2C)R and MC4R stimulus, leading to decreased peripheral ghrelin concentrations.

27325300|t|Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for gastroesophageal reflux disease 2015.
27325300|a|UNASSIGNED: As an increase in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been reported in Japan, and public interest in GERD has been increasing, the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology published the Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for GERD (1st edition) in 2009. Six years have passed since its publication, and there have been a large number of reports in Japan concerning the epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and Barrett's esophagus during this period. By incorporating the contents of these reports, the guidelines were completely revised, and a new edition was published in October 2015. The revised edition consists of eight items: epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, internal treatment, surgical treatment, esophagitis after surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract, extraesophageal symptoms, and Barrett's esophagus. This paper summarizes these guidelines, particularly the parts related to the treatment for GERD. In the present revision, aggressive proton pump inhibitor (PPI) maintenance therapy is recommended for severe erosive GERD, and on-demand therapy or continuous maintenance therapy is recommended for mild erosive GERD or PPI-responsive non-erosive GERD. Moreover, PPI-resistant GERD (insufficient symptomatic improvement and/or esophageal mucosal break persisting despite the administration of PPI at a standard dose for 8  weeks) is defined, and a standard-dose PPI twice a day, change in PPI, change in the PPI timing of dosing, addition of a prokinetic drug, addition of rikkunshito (traditional Japanese herbal medicine), and addition of histamine H2-receptor antagonist are recommended for its treatment. If no improvement is observed even after these treatments, pathophysiological evaluation with esophageal impedance-pH monitoring or esophageal manometry at an expert facility for diseases of the esophagus is recommended.

26833428|t|Impairment of gastric accommodation induced by water-avoidance stress is mediated by 5-HT2B receptors.
26833428|a|BACKGROUND: Psychological stress has been shown to impair gastric accommodation (GA), but its mechanism has not been elucidated. This study was conducted to clarify the role of 5-HT2B receptors in a guinea pig model of stress-induced impairment of GA. METHODS: Gastric accommodation was evaluated by measuring the intrabag pressure in the proximal stomach after administration of a liquid meal. The guinea pigs were subjected to water-avoidance stress. The role of 5-HT2B receptors in impairment of GA was investigated by administering a 5-HT2B receptor agonist (BW723C86) or antagonist (SB215505), the traditional Japanese medicine rikkunshito (RKT), a muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist (1,1-dimethyl-4-diphenylacetoxypiperidium iodide [4-DAMP]), or a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N   -nitro-L-arginine [L-NNA]). KEY RESULTS: In normal animals, liquid meal-induced GA was inhibited by BW723C86, but was not affected by SB215505. The inhibition of GA by BW723C86 was reversed by co-administration of 4-DAMP. Compared to normal animals, GA in stressed animals was significantly inhibited. SB215505 and RKT significantly suppressed stress-induced impairment of GA. After meal administration, the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in gastric fundus tissue increased by approximately twofold in normal animals, but did not change in stressed animals. The inhibition of GA by L-NNA was suppressed by SB215505 or RKT. At a dose that did not affect GA in normal animals, BW723C86 exacerbated the impairment of GA in stressed animals. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Stress-induced impairment of GA may be mediated by an increased responsiveness of 5-HT2B receptors, and activation of the 5-HT2B receptor signaling pathway may have an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide function.

25366479|t|Preparation of goreisan suppository and pharmacokinetics of trans-cinnamic acid after administration to rabbits.
25366479|a|Goreisan suppository is prepared as a hospital preparation, and successfully used for the treatment of diarrhea and vomiting in young children with common cold. While clinical efficacy of the suppository has been reported, few studies have been carried out to clarify the preparation procedure and pharmacokinetics of the suppository. In this study, trans-cinnamic acid (CA) was used as a representative substance of goreisan constituents, and assayed by HPLC-UV. We investigated the properties of goreisan suppositories prepared using various sizes of pulverized goreisan extract granules, in vitro dissolution profiles using the reciprocating dialysis tube method, and pharmacokinetics in rabbits compared with those for goreisan enema. Mass and content uniformity tests on the suppositories of three size fractions, 0-75, 75-150, and 150-300     m, showed good acceptance for all kinds of suppository. Storage stability at 4  C was maintained until 4 months. In vitro dissolution of CA from the suppository was proportional to time until 45   min, and slower than that from the enema. Finally, 80% of CA had dissolved at 60   min. Pharmacokinetic study in rabbits revealed that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 120   min (AUC0-120   min) of the suppository was twice that of the enema. Moreover, from a study in rabbits using CA injection and CA suppository, we revealed that CA was rapidly and well absorbed from the rectum, showing 84% absolute bioavailability. Thus, we illustrated the defined preparation procedure of the suppository and the superiority of the suppository over the enema. This study will support evidence that the suppository is fast-acting and efficacious in clinical use.

25324691|t|Evaluation of the safety and adverse effects of goreisan/wulingsan, a traditional Japanese-chinese herbal formulation (kampo), in a rat model: a toxicological evaluation.
25324691|a|Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death among children less than 5 years of age. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries in the tropical areas of Africa and South Asia. Goreisan/Wulingsan, a formula of Japanese-Chinese medicinal herbs (Kampo), has been used for the treatment of diarrhea and vomiting from ancient times in East Asia. Therefore, we planned a randomized controlled clinical trial of Goreisan/Wulingsan in Bangladeshi children. Although it is believed to be safe in East Asia, information regarding its toxicity on animals is scarce. Since Goreisan/Wulingsan has never been used in Bangladesh, it was necessary to ensure the safety of the formula in an animal experiment. Rats were assigned to a control group (normal saline, n = 4) or various Goreisan/Wulingsan groups (n = 26) receiving doses of 1 to 8 mg/g/day (7.7 to 61.5 times the recommended pediatric dose) over a period of 25 days. Their activities and health conditions were observed until they were sacrificed, after which blood samples were collected for biochemical liver function tests. The kidneys, liver and heart tissue were collected for histopathological study. No lethality was observed during the experiment. All of the rats consumed the doses completely and no constipation was observed, suggesting the absence of any inhibitory effect on intestinal motion. Also, no abnormal neurological activity was detected, nor any significant elevation of AST, ALT or ALP levels, except for AST and ALT at the highest dose of 8 mg/g/day. Histopathological studies of the kidneys, liver and heart tissues revealed no abnormalities. In conclusion, our results showed that Goreisan/Wulingsan is safe for rats, thereby justifying the use of the drug in a human trial.

23037162|t|Effects of Kampo medicines on MDR-1-mediated multidrug resistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma HuH-7/PTX cells.
23037162|a|Paclitaxel-resistant HuH-7 (HuH-7/PTX) cells were established by one-week exposure of HuH-7 cells to paclitaxel to analyze the effects of Kampo medicines on MDR-1-mediated multidrug resistance. HuH-7/PTX cells expressed high levels of MDR-1 and efficiently exported calcein-acetoxymethylester (calcein-AM), which is a substrate of MDR-1, suggesting that HuH-7/PTX cells resist paclitaxel by overexpressing MDR-1. We assessed the effects of 26 kinds of Kampo medicine on MDR-1 by calcein-AM efflux assay using HuH-7/PTX cells, and the results revealed that takushato and goreisan are potential inhibitors of drug efflux by MDR-1. Additionally, the sensitivity of HuH-7/PTX cells to paclitaxel was increased in combination with these Kampo medicines, indicating that takushato and goreisan overcame paclitaxel resistance in the cells by suppressing drug export by MDR-1. We further clarified that Alismatis Rhizoma contained in both takushato and goreisan reversed paclitaxel resistance by preventing drug efflux by MDR-1 without affecting the expression levels of MDR-1. Moreover, the principal components of Alismatis Rhizoma, Alisol A, Alisol B, and Alisol B acetate, were found to increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in HuH-7/PTX by inhibiting drug export by MDR-1 without affecting the expression levels of MDR-1. These results suggested that the reversal effects of takushato and goreisan on paclitaxel resistance are derived from these principal components in Alismatis Rhizoma. Accordingly, Kampo medicines containing Alismatis Rhizoma such as takushato and goreisan may be useful as MDR-1 inhibitors.

19885029|t|Water extract of samultang reduces apoptotic cell death by h(2)o(2)-induced oxidative injury in sk-N-mc cells.
19885029|a|The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the water extract of Samultang (SMT), a Chinese herb, on apoptotic cell death by H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress in SK-N-MC cells. A nuclear fragmentation was observed via fluorescence imaging 12 h after exposure to 30 microM H(2)O(2) and DNA laddering was detected via agarose electrophoresis gel. In addition, increases in sub-G1 phase and cleavage of the PARP protein were observed. However, treatment with SMT for 2 h prior to H(2)O(2) exposure significantly reduced apoptotic cell death induced by incubation with 30 microM H(2)O(2) in SK-N-MC cells. Pre-incubation with water extract of SMT for 2 h prevented the H(2)O(2)-induced decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. SMT also attenuated the increase in caspase-3 activity and the breakdown of PARP protein caused by H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. These results suggest that the water extract of SMT provides inhibition of apoptotic cell death against oxidative injury in SK-N-MC cells.

7719102|a|The effect of Sheng Mai San (SMS) on the coronary heart disease (CHD) patients (30 angina pectoris and 68 acute myocardial infarction, AMI) and its peroxidation damage was studied. It was shown that the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in blood were decreased and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma was increased in CHD patients in comparison with the healthy controls (P < 0.001). When SMS was orally administered in 38 AMI patients, both SOD and GSH-Px activities were increased and the level of MDA decreased (P < 0.05), and these changes were even more significant when SMS was further ingested for another two weeks (P < 0.001). At the same time, it was found that the changes of SOD, GSH-Px and MDA in the control group (30 AMI patients not taking SMS) were not significantly different (P > 0.05). It could be assumed that the pathogenesis of CHD is associated with free radical (FR) triggering a chain reaction of the lipid peroxidation, and that SMS is acting as an effective free radical scavenger, which would ameliorate the lipid peroxidation damage. Thus, SMS could be administered in the prevention and the treatment of CHD.

2615407|t|Effect of shosaikoto on plasma catecholamines.
2615407|a|Plasma adrenaline (AD) and noradrenaline (NA) were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with an electrochemical detector. In an experiment using non-treated adrenalectomized rats, most plasma AD appeared to originate from the adrenal medulla, while plasma NA came from other sites. When Shosaikoto, a Japanese and Chinese traditional medicinal mixture, was orally administered to rats, plasma AD levels decreased in a significant manner 60 min after treatment, while plasma NA levels were not changed. Pretreatment with pentobarbital inhibited the Shosaikoto-induced decrease of plasma AD levels.

9866980|t|[Pulmonary edema associated with the Chinese medicine shosaikoto].
9866980|a|A 45-year-old Japanese woman presented with a high fever, a nonproductive coughing, and severe dyspnea, and was admitted to another hospital. During the week prior to hospitalization, she had been given Shosaikoto for treatment of liver dysfunction of unknown etiology. Mycoplasma pneumonitis was initially suspected, so she was treated with antibiotics (clindamycin and minocycline) and received oxygen therapy. Pulmonary insufficiency worsened rapidly, and she was transferred to our hospital. On admission, a chest roentgenogram revealed bilateral alveolar infiltrates predominantly in the medial lung fields. Furosemide and high-dose methylprednisolone were immediately administered, but hypoxemia increased. When the PaO2 was 55.7 Torr while the patient breathed 100% oxygen, mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was started. Arterial blood-gas values improved dramatically, and the chest roentgenogram became clear. Our diagnosis of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is based on the chest-roentgenographic findings, infiltration of inflammatory cells as seen in two lung-biopsy specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the lack of findings of heart failure on physical examination and electrocardiography, and the good clinical response to PEEP. A positive lymphocyte stimulation test in response to Shosaikoto implicated this non-traditional herbal medicine as an etiologic factor in the non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Shosaikoto has been identified as the cause of interstitial pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia, but pulmonary edema associated with Shosaikoto has not been previously described. This case suggests that methylprednisolone treatment may be insufficient for Shosaikoto-induced pulmonary edema, and that mechanical ventilation with PEEP is very effective.

18059152|t|[Evaluation of the drug lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) with shosaikoto].
18059152|a|BACKGROUND: Our aim is to evaluate the significance of DLST by Shosaikoto. METHODS: We clinically evaluated 3 cases of drug-induced pneumonia assumed to be caused by Shosaikoto, and we performed DLST of Shosaikoto for healthy controls, and compared the data with drug-induced pneumonia cases of Shosaikoto. RESULTS: As clinical characteristics of 3 cases, 2 cases were positive for hepatitis C virus antibody, and 1 case was positive for DLST of Shosaikoto. The observed chest high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings showed hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP) pattern in all 3 cases. Prognosis was good in all 3 cases. DLST of Shosaikoto was positive in 27.5% of healthy controls. Stimulation index (S.I.) of DLST in drug-induced pneumonia cases increased depending on drug dilution density, compared to that of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: DLST of Shosaikoto showed high false-positive rate. However, we may be able to distinguish the true-positive cases with the false-positive cases by comparing the S.I. of DLST according to drug dilution density.

12937613|t|Shosaikoto as a potential antiatherosclerotic agent.
12937613|a|Shosaikoto, a Kampo medicine used clinically to treat patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis in Japan, displays immunoregulatory effects, especially on macrophage functions. Oral administration of shosaikoto influences the synthesis of humoral factors such as the interleukins, nitric oxide and prostaglandins in macrophages. In addition, phagocytic activity is enhanced by treatment with shosaikoto, resulting in an antigen that is effectively presented to T lymphocytes to produce more antibodies. The role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is well recognized, although a therapeutic agent targeted at macrophages has not yet been developed. When shosaikoto was administered to atherosclerotic rabbits, it did not exhibit antihyperlipidemic effects but did reduce the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, treatment with shosaikoto suppressed intimal hyperplasia in apoE-deficient mice fed a cholesterol-enriched diet for nine weeks. Biochemical studies demonstrated that the mechanism of the antiatherosclerotic effect was partly due to the increase of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) elimination by macrophages, resulting from stimulation of oxLDL uptake through scavenger receptors, activation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase, and increase of cholesterol elimination by high-density lipoprotein. Furthermore, shosaikoto is able to reverse the depression of macrophage functions caused by hyperlipidemia. These results indicate the potential of this medicine as a new type of preventive or therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis.

1967114|t|Response of liver to glucocorticoid is altered by administration of shosaikoto (kampo medicine).
1967114|a|The effects of Shosaikoto, one of the Kampo medicines used for therapy for chronic hepatitis, on liver functions were studied in mice. Oral administration of Shosaikoto for 5 d enhanced the well-known induction of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity by dexamethasone. Further, TAT activity in mice treated with Shosaikoto was induced effectively by a smaller dose of dexamethasone, as compared with that in control mice. However, Shosaikoto itself did not induce TAT activity in the liver on oral administration or in cultured hepatocytes by direct addition. Moreover, Shosaikoto did not affect the induction of TAT activity by butyryl-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. The amplifying effect of Shosaikoto seemed to be specific for induction by dexamethasone. These data suggest that Shosaikoto makes the liver sensitive to glucocorticoid by some unknown mechanism.

2335963|a|The possibility of naturally occurring amnesia was examined in aging Fischer F254 rats. Animals 110 weeks old showed a loss of learning and memory in a passive avoidance responses (PAR) failure test. When 120 mg/kg/day of Shosaikoto extract was placed in the diet after 72 weeks of age to 110 weeks, it improved age-induced PAR failure in both the two-compartment avoidance box test and the step-down test. The responses of 110-week-old Shosaikoto-treated rats on both PAR failures were almost the same as those of non-treated 6-week-old rats. In these Shosaikoto-treated rats, dopamine was increased and norepinephrine and vanillyl mandelic acid were decreased in brain relative to those in non-treated aging rats.

8889034|t|Anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-atherosclerotic actions of shosaikoto (kampo medicine).
8889034|a|We investigated the anti-atherosclerotic action shown by Shosaikoto, a Kampo medicine, using hypercholesterolemic mice. Oral administration of Shosaikoto significantly suppressed the elevation of serum cholesterol in C57BL/6 mice fed a 1.25% cholesterol-enriched diet for four weeks and improved the T cell ratio in peripheral blood, which decreased with the increase of the serum cholesterol level. In addition, Shosaikoto reduced the accumulation of cholesteryl oleate, which alters macrophages into foam cells, after the treatment of macrophages with oxidized or acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL). Enzymatic study revealed that the treatment of macrophages with oxidized LDL enhanced acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity and markedly reduced neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (NCEase) activity. Shosaikoto treatment prevented a decrease in the NCEase activity, however due to the oxidized LDL treatment, although it slightly augmented ACAT activity. Thus, Shosaikoto, which is known to modulate the immune system, improves macrophage and lymphocyte functions diminished by hypercholesterolemia, resulting in an anti-atherosclerotic action.

12795186|a|A 78-year-old woman was admitted to our institution because of dyspnea on exertion. The history of the present illness indicated that for past two years, she had been taking a Chinese herbal medicine (Shosaikoto), believed to be used for the treatment of liver dysfunction of unknown etiology. A chest radiograph showed a butterfly shadow in the middle of the lower lung fields. The arterial blood gases showed marked hypoxemia. A tentative diagnosis of drug-induced pneumonia was made, and so she was given methylprednisolone pulse therapy, but no improvement was seen. Acute respiratory failure occurred, and artificial mechanical ventilation was instituted with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a bloody fluid which suggested alveolar extravasation of red blood cells. She was given a second course of pulse therapy, and the pulmonary edema began to resolve, and so corticosteroid was tapered off. She was then discharged. In the outpatient clinic, a lymphocyte stimulating test was performed, and showed a positive reaction for Shosaikoto. The above findings suggested Shosaikoto-induced non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a rarely seen disorder.

Sannoshashinto, Shosaikoto and Daisaikoto reduced the hypercholesterolemia induced by a high cholesterol diet and Sannoshashinto and Daisaikoto improved the atherogenetic index. Liver total cholesterol as increased by a high cholesterol diet was reduced by all three kampohozai. Furthermore, the increases of serum and liver triglyceride were also inhibited. In an experiment using untreated aging rats, both serum total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels were increased. The aging-induced increases of serum total cholesterol were inhibited by Sannoshashinto and Daisaikoto and the increases of serum triglyceride were reduced by all three kampohozai. These drugs showed no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in liver. Sannoshashinto, however, appeared to accelerate the disappearance of cholesterol from blood, while Daisaikoto inhibited the cholesterol absorption from the intestine.

Adjuvant therapy with Shosaikoto and Hocheukito suppressed INH induced hepato-dermatological toxicosis moderately and suppressed SM induced high fever completely. By these anti-allergic therapy, combined chemotherapy with SM, EB, PAS and PZA became possible during more than six months, and chemotherapeutic effect was marked.

8951166|a|Macrophages play important roles both in immune response and in lipid metabolism and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. To clarify the mechanism by which Shosaikoto, a Kampo medicine, shows anti-atherosclerotic action, we studied its effect on macrophage function. The production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 and interleukin 1 by macrophages in mice was reduced by feeding of a cholesterol-enriched diet, and the reduced production was observed 1 week after the beginning of cholesterol feeding. Furthermore, although oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) reduced NO production, macrophages prepared from mice treated with Shosaikoto at a dose of 1.2 g/kg/d restored the reduced NO production by them as well as by hypercholesterolemia. When the content of LPC was measured, no difference was observed between mice fed a cholesterol-enriched diet in the presence or absence of Shosaikoto treatment, suggesting that the restorative effect of Shosaikoto is not due to the inhibition of LPC production or accumulation. Conclusively, Shosaikoto prevents the modification of macrophage function induced by atherogenic factors, which is probably linked to its displayed anti-atherosclerotic action.

21358120|t|In vivo inhibition of CYP3A-mediated midazolam metabolism by anchusan in rats.
21358120|a|Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug interactions caused by Kampo medicine have not been investigated sufficiently. The current study was conducted to reveal the effect of anchusan, a commonly used Kampo formula for gastrointestinal disease, on CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism in rats. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam (MDZ) was investigated after the single or one-week administration of anchusan (500 mg/kg) to evaluate its inhibitory and inducible effect on CYP3A, respectively. MDZ was administrated 16 h after the last anchsan treatment in the multiple dose study, while their intervals were 2 or 16 h in the single dose study. Unexpectedly, the multiple-pretreatment of anchusan increased the AUC of MDZ by 2.4-fold rather than decreasing it, and the CYP3A contents and activities were unchanged in hepatic and intestinal microsomes of these rats. In contrast, no significant inhibitory effects on MDZ metabolism were observed by the single anchusan pretreatment. In vitro study showed that the preincubation of anchusan and some of its component extracts with rat liver microsomes reduced CYP3A activity in a time- and NADPH-dependent manner. These results suggested that anchusan increased the serum MDZ concentration in rats, at least in part, by the time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A.

12639426|a|There is considerable difference in the texts between PEF and the archaic editions Sun zhen ren qian jin fang (The Immortal Sun's Precious Formulary, ISPF) and the Song - revised edition Bei ji qian jin yao fang (Precious Essential Formulary for Emergency, PEFE). It is hoped that the real features of PEF can be worked out through collated studies on these two editions so as to offer a basis for systematic research on PEF. At the same time, it has been proved that during the revision and collation of PEF by the Song scholars, it is certain that dramatic revisions had been made on its medical materials, especially an abundant amount of medical materials were added. As a result, the current circulated edition of PEFE does have obvious differences with Sun's original work, while ISPF, in contrast, preserves the original features of Sun Simiao. Hence, ISPF is of important academic significance in the in - depth study of PEF.

17144193|a|This paper aimed to introduce and examine the biography of Sun Xi-miao which I found in The Biography of The Avatamsaka-Sutra, that Fazang) wrote in 692 A.D. This document was neglected to understand Sun who was the famous medical writer of the collection of prescriptions, the Bei ji qian jin yao fang. His life is rather well documented, because he has his own biographies in Jiu Tang shu and Xin Tang shu which cited from Da Tang sin yu, published in 807. But I found several new informations about Sun in The Biography of The Avatamsaka-Sutra, such as he use to be a military medicine in the troops of Li Yuan who became the first emperor, Kao Tsu of Tang dynasty and treat Sun with great favour. This document let us know that the Bei ji qian jin yao fang was dedicated to Kao Tsu, known as published in 652 A.D. My conclusions are as follows: First, it was written by Fazang in 692 A.D, who was the real establisher of the fraternity of the Avatamsaka in China, for the purpose of encouraging to copy the Avatamsaka-Sutra. According to this biography, Sun made 750 copies to persuade the monks and the peoples, and that's the reason Fazang wrote his biography. Secondly, it was not conveyed to posterity, such as Sun was good looking, tall and use to be the medicine of Kao Tsu and dedicated his medical book to the first emperor. It might be left out for Tai Tsung's sake in the official records, who murdered his brother, the heir apparent to the throne, and became the second emperor by himself. On the contrary, it was written in Da Tang sin yu, Jiu and Xin Tang shu that Sun made a prediction that his collection of prescriptions would help the holyman after 50 years from Xuan Di of Northern Chou Dynasty. Holyman meant Tai Tsung. I shows that Sun's biographies in the Da Tang sin yu, Jiu and Xin Tang Shu were based on the documents that might be fabricated and embellished for Tai Tsung. Thirdly, this biography let us know that Sun wote the Bei ji qian jin yao fang under the circumstances that the epidemic disease was spreaded in Changan at 618 A.D. and the population of Kao Tsu era (618-626) was decreased rapidly. I think that's why he wrote down the medical morals as the first chapter, and the prescriptions about the gynecology and pediatrics as the second chapter.

12398073|a|The emergency treatments for the damage and bleeding of the vagina, and the sharp pubic pain of young virgins which were caused occurred by the sexual art, were recorded in traditional medicine books, such as the "Ji yan fang" and others. It is a fact that in ancient China some people used the sexual art of having intercourse with several young virgins at the same time in order to increase their health and keep perpetual youth and longevity. The famous traditional general-medical book, "qian jin yao fang" recommended that method to rich persons too. It is supposed that the beginning of the sexual art of having intercourse with several young virgins traces back to the times of Emperor Hanwu , but it seems to have disappeared from the historical stage in the Song period. On the other hand, the criticisms from the traditional medicine books and the secret languages of internal alchemy used for the Taoist sacred books show that the sexual art of having intercourse with several young virgins was still going on behind the scene in the Ming and Qing periods. Even if we consider the historical changes of ethics and mortality, we now cannot but criticize this behavior of abusing juveniles for the sexual art.

27703356|t|Nine traditional Chinese herbal formulas for the treatment of depression: an ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacology review.
27703356|a|UNASSIGNED: Depression is a major mental disorder, and is currently recognized as the second-leading cause of disability worldwide. However, the therapeutic effect of antidepressants remains unsatisfactory. For centuries, Chinese herbal formulas (CHFs) have been widely used in the treatment of depression, achieving better therapeutic effects than placebo and having fewer side effects than conventional antidepressants. Here, we review the ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, and pharmacology studies of nine common CHFs: "banxia houpo" decoction, "chaihu shugansan", "ganmaidazao" decoction, "kaixinsan", "shuganjieyu" capsules, "sinisan", "wuling" capsules, "xiaoyaosan", and "yueju". Eight clinical trials and seven meta-analyses have supported the theory that CHFs are effective treatments for depression, decreasing Hamilton Depression Scale scores and showing few adverse effects. Evidence from 75 preclinical studies has also elucidated the multitarget and multipathway mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect of the nine CHFs. Decoctions, capsules, and pills all showed antidepressant effects, ranked in descending order of efficacy. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, these CHFs have flexible compatibility and mainly act by soothing the liver and relieving depression. This review highlights the effective treatment choices and candidate compounds for patients, practitioners, and researchers in the field of traditional Chinese medicine. In summary, the current evidence supports the efficacy of CHFs in the treatment of depression, but additional large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials and sophisticated pharmacology studies should be performed.

22096851|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of "XUE BI JING plus LIANQIAO" injection on gene expression levels of rats with sepsis model. METHODS: One hundred and twenty rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, sepsis model group, Te-neng group and "XUE BI JING plus forsythia suspension" group. The sepsis model of rats was prepared by "CLP" method. Tai neng group was treated by peritoneal injection Imipenem/ Cilastatin (0.18 g/kg); "XUE BI JING plus LIANQIAO" group was treated by peritoneal injection Imipenem/ Cilastatin (0.18 g/kg) plus "xue-bi-jing" (10 ml/kg) and "liang ge san" (18 g/200 g) by intragastric administration 2 times a day; the sham operation group and model group were treated by peritoneal injection of normal saline (10 ml/kg). The survival rates at 48h and 72h were observed for all groups. The gene expression levels of livers in all groups were detected by BiostarR-40s chip. The NCBI database was used to inquest Gene function and class. RESULTS: The survival rates at 48h and 72h in "XUE BI JING+ forsythia suspension" group were 83.3% and 76.7% which were significantly higher than those (30.0% and 16.7%) in sepsis model group and those (60.0% and 33.3%) in Te-neng group (P < 0.01). Model group/control group have 305 differential expression genes with 159 up-regulation genes and 146 down-regulation genes. Tai-neng group/model group have 386 differential expression genes with 206 up-regulation genes and 180 down-regulation genes. "XUE BI JING plus forsythia suspension" group/model group have 342 differential expression genes with 102 up-regulation genes and 240 downregulation genes. The genes with up-regulation in model group/ control group and with down-regulation in"XUE BI JING plus forsythia suspension" group/model group were 24. The genes with down-regulation in the model group/ sham operation group and with up-regulation in "XUE BI JING plus forsythia suspension"group/model group were 16. CONCLUSION: "XUE BI JING plus forsythia suspension" can reduce the mortality of rats with sepsis, which could be due to the expression of relative regulation genes.

27493481|t|Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study of Ranitidine and Daijokito in Healthy Volunteers.
27493481|a|BACKGROUND: Ranitidine is a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, and daijokito is a Kampo (Chinese herbal medicine as practiced in Japan) formula, which is traditionally used for treating constipation and digestive trouble. Previous study demonstrated that daijokito significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in rats; however, the doses of ranitidine and daijokito in that study were higher than in clinical practice. Therefore, we examined the pharmacokinetic interaction between ranitidine and daijokito in clinical practice doses in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was a randomized, open label, two-period crossover study in healthy volunteers (n = 7). Volunteers received administrations of either a single dose of ranitidine 300 mg, or ranitidine 300 mg in combination with daijokito extract granules 2.5 g. Plasma concentrations of ranitidine were measured over 12 h by LC/MS/MS method. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of ranitidine were lower with co-administration of daijokito compared with ranitidine alone. Co-administration of daijokito significantly decreased ranitidine area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC0-12) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) with geometric mean (GM) ratio [90% confidence interval (CI)] for AUC0-12 of 0.609 (0.449, 0.826) and Cmax of 0.515 (0.345, 0.771). CONCLUSION: Co-administration of ranitidine with daijokito resulted in a significant decrease in plasma level of ranitidine in healthy volunteers.

25581163|t|Does inchinkoto, a herbal medicine, have hepatoprotective effects in major hepatectomy? A prospective randomized study.
25581163|a|OBJECTIVES: This randomized clinical trial was designed to investigate whether inchinkoto has a hepatoprotective effect on postoperative outcome after major hepatectomy. METHODS: Sixty-one patients scheduled for major hepatectomy were randomly assigned to one of two groups in which preoperative inchinkoto was (inchinkoto group, n = 30) or was not (non-inchinkoto group, n = 31) administered. Inchinkoto was administered for at least 7 days before surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of post-hepatectomy liver damage. The expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and other oxygen stress-related markers in the liver were also determined. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in clinical characteristics between the inchinkoto and non-inchinkoto groups. Serum levels in liver function tests and incidences of post-hepatectomy liver failure did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, there was a significantly higher induction of antioxidant factors in the liver, such as Nrf2 protein and heme oxygenase-1 mRNA, after hepatectomy in the inchinkoto group than in the non-inchinkoto group. CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative administration of inchinkoto did not have a significant impact on the overall outcome of major hepatectomy. However, inchinkoto induced the expression of Nrf2 during hepatectomy and may have exerted an antioxidative effect on the liver.

19054142|t|Choleretic effect of inchinkoto, a herbal medicine, on livers of patients with biliary obstruction due to bile duct carcinoma.
19054142|a|AIM: To investigate the choleretic effects of inchinkoto (ICKT) on livers of patients with biliary obstruction due to bile duct carcinoma. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with bile duct carcinoma who were due to undergo biliary drainage and subsequent major hepatectomy were randomly assigned to preoperative ICKT (n = 13) or untreated (n = 14) groups. ICKT was administered from the day of admission until one day before surgery. Changes in bile constituents, expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2, MRP3 and MRP4 in the liver, and the incidence of postoperative complications were included as end-points. RESULTS: The biliary concentration of total bilirubin was significantly increased after administration of ICKT (23.7 +/- 2.8 mg/dL before ICKT; 34.0 +/- 4.0 mg/dL after ICKT, P < 0.05). The biliary concentration of total bile acids was also significantly increased. Protein levels of MRP2 and MRP3 in the crude plasma membrane fraction of livers of treated patients were significantly higher than those without treatment. MRP2 staining in the livers of patients without ICKT treatment was weak and diffuse around the bile canaliculi, whereas staining in patients with ICKT treatment was strong and restricted to the bile canaliculi. CONCLUSION: ICKT exerts a choleretic effect on the livers of patients with biliary obstruction. This beneficial effect was associated with increased expression of MRP2. ICKT thus has therapeutic potential for treatment for obstructive cholestasis due to bile duct carcinoma.

21988272|t|Japanese herbal medicine, inchinkoto, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase induction in interleukin-1b-stimulated hepatocytes.
21988272|a|AIM:     A herbal medicine, kampo inchinkoto (TJ-135), is used to treat jaundice and liver fibrosis in patients with cirrhosis. In the inflamed liver, proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. Over-production of nitric oxide (NO) by iNOS has been implicated as a factor in liver injury. We examined interleukin (IL)-1b-stimulated hepatocytes as a simple in vitro injury model to determine liver-protective effects of TJ-135. The objective was to investigate whether TJ-135 influences iNOS induction and to determine its mechanism. METHODS:     Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with IL-1b in the presence or absence of TJ-135. The induction of iNOS and its signaling pathway were analyzed. RESULTS:     IL-1b produced increased levels of NO. This effect was inhibited by TJ-135, which exerted its maximal effects at 3   mg/mL. TJ-135 decreased the levels of iNOS protein and its mRNA expression. Experiments with nuclear extracts revealed that TJ-135 inhibited the translocation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) to the nucleus and its DNA binding. TJ-135 also inhibited the activation of Akt, resulting in the reduction of type I IL-1 receptor mRNA and protein expression. Transfection experiments with iNOS promoter-luciferase constructs demonstrated that TJ-135 suppressed iNOS induction by inhibition of promoter transactivation and mRNA stabilization. TJ-135 reduced the expression of an iNOS gene antisense-transcript. Delayed administration or withdrawal of TJ-135 after IL-1b addition also inhibited iNOS induction. CONCLUSIONS:     RESULTS indicate that TJ-135 inhibits the induction of iNOS at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps, leading to the prevention of NO production. TJ-135 may have therapeutic potential for various liver injuries through the suppression of iNOS induction.

19962433|t|Active ingredients of traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine, inchinkoto, in murine concanavalin A-induced hepatitis.
19962433|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: The traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine inchinkoto (ICKT) is used in Eastern Asia as a choleretic and hepatoprotective agent. Previously, we reported that ICKT ameliorates murine concanavalin A (con A)-induced hepatitis via suppression of interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-12 production. In the present study, we investigated the active ingredients of ICKT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ICKT and extracts of its component herbs were fractionated, and their effects on liver injury and cytokine production in vivo (biochemical markers of liver injury and cytokine levels in serum) and in vitro (cytokine and nitrite production in the cultures of splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages). RESULTS: Decoctions of component herbs, Artemisiae Capillari Spica (Artemisia capillaris Thunberg: 'Inchinko' in Japanese), Gardeniae Fructus (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis: 'Sanshishi') and Rhei Rhizoma (Rheum palmatum Linn  : 'Daio') were administered orally. Inchinko and Sanshishi decreased serum transaminases and IFN-gamma concentrations. Examination of fractions of component herbs suggested that capillarisin, a component of Inchinko, has potent hepatoprotective activity in vivo. In in vitro studies, capillarisin and genipin, an intestinal metabolite of geniposide that is contained in Sanshishi, were examined. IFN-gamma production was significantly suppressed by capillarisin and genipin in con A-stimulated splenocyte culture. Genipin also suppressed IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-12p70 synthesis. Capillarisin and genipin decreased nitrite release from IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that both Inchinko and Sanshishi may contribute to the protective effects of ICKT against con A hepatitis. Capillarisin was found to be potently hepatoprotective, and genipin may also contribute, especially via modulation of cytokine production.

20224363|t|Inchinkoto, an herbal medicine, exerts beneficial effects in the rat liver under stress with hepatic ischemia-reperfusion and subsequent hepatectomy.
20224363|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the beneficial effects of inchinkoto (ICKT) in the liver after 70% hepatectomy following ischemia reperfusion. METHODS: Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: simple laparotomy and 70% hepatectomy (Hx), 70% hepatectomy following ischemia reperfusion (IR) with vehicle (IRHxV), 70% hepatectomy following IR with ICKT (1 or 2 g/kg of body weight; IRHxK). Vehicle or ICKT was administered for 3 days preoperatively. The hepatoduodenal ligament was clamped for 15 minutes before hepatectomy in the IRHx groups. Rats were killed 1 hours after hepatectomy. In other experiments, the hepatoduodenal ligament was clamped for 30 minutes, with or without ICKT treatment, to evaluate the effect of ICKT on IR injury-induced mortality. Serum transaminase levels and the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the remnant liver were determined. Furthermore, the expression of antioxidant genes was evaluated by PCR array. RESULTS: The elevation of serum transaminase levels, the upregulation of genes for inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the increased formation of nitrotyrosine observed in the remnant livers of the IRHxV group were all significantly attenuated by preoperative administration of ICKT in the IRHxK group. The expression of antioxidant genes was also higher in the IRHxK group compared with that of the IRHxV group. Moreover, administration of ICKT significantly reduced the mortality induced by IRHx after 30-minute ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative administration of ICKT provides beneficial effects through attenuating inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in the liver following IR and subsequent hepatectomy.

27774888|t|Genipin inhibits the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase through the inhibition of NF-kB activation in rat hepatocytes.
27774888|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Genipin is a component of Japanese traditional herbal medicine (Kampo), inchinkoto, and is used for the treatment of various liver injuries. However, there are few scientific evidence for its anti-inflammatory effects and mechanisms. In inflamed liver, proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b stimulate liver cells, followed by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Excessive levels of NO produced by iNOS have been implicated as one of the factors in liver injury. We examined the protective effects of genipin on the liver by studying its influence on the induction of iNOS and NO production as a liver injury marker in cultured hepatocytes "in vitro liver injury model". METHODS: Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with IL-1b in the presence or absence of genipin. The induction of NO production and iNOS, and its signaling pathway were analyzed. RESULTS: In IL-1b-stimulated hepatocytes, genipin inhibited the production of NO dose- and time-dependently, and reduced the levels of iNOS protein and its mRNA expression. Genipin also reduced mRNA expressions of TNF-a and IL-6. Genipin inhibited two essential signaling pathways for iNOS induction, IkB degradation/NF-kB activation and type I IL-1 receptor upregulation. Transfection experiments revealed that genipin decreased the expression of iNOS mRNA through both inhibitions of the promoter activation and mRNA stabilization. Delayed administration of genipin after IL-1b addition also inhibited iNOS induction. CONCLUSIONS: Genipin influenced the induction of inflammatory mediators, iNOS and TNF-a, in part through the inhibition of NF-kB activation in hepatocytes. Genipin may have therapeutic potential for organ injuries including liver.

24693448|t|Preventive Effects of a Kampo Medicine, Kakkonto, on Inflammatory Responses via the Suppression of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Phosphorylation in Lipopolysaccharide-Treated Human Gingival Fibroblasts.
24693448|a|Periodontal disease is accompanied by inflammation of the gingiva and destruction of periodontal tissues, leading to alveolar bone loss in severe clinical cases. The chemical mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-)6 and IL-8 have been known to play important roles in inflammatory responses and tissue degradation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a kampo medicine, kakkonto (TJ-1), on the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-6, and IL-8 by human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Kakkonto concentration dependently suppressed LPS-induced PGE2 production but did not alter basal PGE2 levels. In contrast, kakkonto significantly increased LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 production. Kakkonto decreased cyclooxygenase- (COX-)1 activity to approximately 70% at 1   mg/mL but did not affect COX-2 activity. Kakkonto did not affect cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), annexin1, or LPS-induced COX-2 expression. Kakkonto suppressed LPS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, which is known to lead to ERK activation and cPLA2 phosphorylation. These results suggest that kakkonto decreased PGE2 production by inhibition of ERK phosphorylation which leads to inhibition of cPLA2 phosphorylation and its activation. Therefore, kakkonto may be useful to improve gingival inflammation in periodontal disease.

27097321|t|Induction of Regulatory T Cells as a Novel Mechanism Underlying the Therapeutic Action of Kakkonto, a Traditional Japanese Herbal Medicine, in a Murine Food Allergy Model.
27097321|a|BACKGROUND: The number of patients with food allergy (FA) has dramatically increased. Although satisfactory drug therapies for FA are not available, we have found that kakkonto, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, suppressed the occurrence of allergic symptoms in an FA mouse model. Thus, we investigated whether kakkonto could regulate the activation and differentiation of T cells in the colon. METHODS: BALB/c mice were systemically sensitized and then orally challenged with ovalbumin. FA mice were orally treated with kakkonto. Lamina propria (LP) cells from their colons were isolated and analyzed. RESULTS: Kakkonto significantly reduced the proportion of CD69+ cells and the elevated helper T cell type 2-specific transcription factor GATA-3 mRNA expression in the LP CD4+ T cells, showing that kakkonto has a suppressive effect on the activation and Th2 differentiation of LP effector CD4+ T cells of the FA mouse colon. Furthermore, kakkonto significantly increased the proportion of Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells in the LP CD4+ T cells of the FA mouse colon. Similarly, the number of Foxp3-positive cells was dramatically increased in the colonic mucosa of kakkonto-administered FA mice. However, the pharmacological effect and Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cell-inducing ability of kakkonto were not attenuated by the administration of an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody in the FA model. CONCLUSIONS: The induction of Foxp3+CD4+CD25- regulatory T cells in the colon as a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic action of kakkonto could be utilized for the development of a novel anti-FA drug.

18849609|t|Therapeutic effect of kakkonto in a mouse model of food allergy with gastrointestinal symptoms.
18849609|a|BACKGROUND: The number of patients with food allergy has increased dramatically over the last several decades. However, there is no effective drug for food allergies. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of kakkonto, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, in a mouse model of food allergy with gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: BALB/c mice were systemically sensitized twice with ovalbumin (OVA) and then were repeatedly given OVA by oral intubation (OVA mice). Kakkonto was administered orally before the OVA challenges. RESULTS: The OVA mice developed allergic diarrhea (91.8 +/- 3.8% after 6 OVA challenges), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was dramatically elevated in the colons of the OVA mice. Kakkonto significantly suppressed the occurrence of allergic diarrhea and MPO activity in the OVA mice. Furthermore, the number of mucosal mast cells was greatly increased in the proximal colons of the OVA mice, and this was also suppressed by kakkonto. Interestingly, mRNA expression of helper T cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines (IFN-gamma) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10) were significantly upregulated in the proximal colons of the OVA mice, an effect which was also reduced by kakkonto. Transcriptome analysis detected increased mRNA expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 in the proximal colons of OVA mice, which was decreased by kakkonto administration. CONCLUSION: Kakkonto has immunosuppressive effects and interferes with the infiltration of mucosal mast cells in the colons of mice with induced food allergy, leading to improvement of allergic symptoms. Kakkonto has potential as a therapeutic drug for treatment of allergic symptoms induced by the disruption of intestinal mucosal immunity.

21199639|t|Letter: Fixed drug eruption caused by the Japanese herbal drug kakkonto.
21199639|a|Herbal drugs are now widely used throughout the world. The general public tends to believe these agents to be safe because of their natural origin; thus, they are used frequently. However, the side effects of many of these potent chemicals may be significant. Several cases of fixed drug eruption (FDE) caused by herbal drugs have been reported. We herein report a case of FDE caused by kakkonto.

25788966|t|The inhibitory effect of kakkonto, Japanese traditional (kampo) medicine, on brain penetration of oseltamivir carboxylate in mice with reduced blood-brain barrier function.
25788966|a|Oseltamivir phosphate (OP) is used to treat influenza virus infections. However, its use may result in central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects. In Japan, OP is used with Kampo formulations to improve clinical effectiveness. We evaluated the potential for using Kampo formulations to reduce CNS adverse effects by quantifying the CNS distribution of oseltamivir and its active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) when administered with maoto and kakkonto. We administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by intraperitoneal injection to C57BL/6 mice to reduce blood-brain barrier function. Saline, maoto, and kakkonto were administered orally at the same time as LPS. OP was orally administered 4 hours after the last LPS injection and the migration of oseltamivir and OC was examined. Additionally, we examined the brain distribution of OC following intravenous administration. Changes in OC concentrations in the brain suggest that, in comparison to LPS-treated control mice, both Kampo formulations increased plasma levels of OC, thereby enhancing its therapeutic effect. Additionally, our findings suggest kakkonto may not only improve the therapeutic effect of oseltamivir but also reduce the risk of CNS-based adverse effects. Considering these findings, it should be noted that administration of kakkonto during periods of inflammation has led to increased OAT3 expression.

20091242|t|Comparison of the contents of kampo decoctions containing ephedra herb when prepared simply or by re-boiling according to the traditional theory.
20091242|a|Herbal formulas containing ephedra herb (mao-zai) are among the most important medicinal prescriptions in Japanese traditional kampo medicine to treat cold symptoms, bronchial asthma, arthralgia, and rheumatism. Shokan-zatsubyo-ron (Shanghan zabing lun in Chinese), a classical textbook of kampo medicine published in 220 A.D., describes that when herbal formulas containing ephedra herb (stem of Ephedra sinica) such as maoto (mahuang-tang) and kakkonto (gegen-tang) are prepared, ephedra herb is first boiled alone, the scum is removed, and then other crude drugs are added and decocted. In the present study, we evaluated evidence for the benefit of boiling ephedra herb prior to other crude drugs by analyzing the contents of the extract and four ephedrine alkaloids (ephedrine, methylephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and norephedrine), which are considered the main active ingredients in ephedra herb. We prepared two different decoctions of maoto and kakkonto: one decoction was prepared by boiling all the crude drugs at the same time and the other decoction was prepared according to the classical textbook. In both decoctions of maoto and kakkonto, neither alkaloid contents in the extract nor extracting ratio of four ephedrine alkaloids exhibited significant difference. As far as the ephedrine alkaloid content goes, there is no evidence for the benefit of the boiling method for ephedra herb described in the classical textbook of kampo medicine.

27819025|t|Studies on Shokyo, Kanzo, and Keihi in Kakkonto Medicine on Prostaglandin E2 Production in Lipopolysaccharide-Treated Human Gingival Fibroblasts.
27819025|a|UNASSIGNED: We previously demonstrated that a kampo medicine, kakkonto, decreases lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by human gingival fibroblasts. In this study, we examined the herbs constituting kakkonto that exhibit this effect. Shokyo strongly and concentration dependently and kanzo and keihi moderately decreased LPS-induced PGE2 production. Shokyo did not alter cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), annexin 1 and COX-2 expression, and LPS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Kanzo inhibited COX-2 activity but increased annexin 1 and COX-2 expression and did not alter LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation. Keihi inhibited COX-2 activity and LPS-induced ERK phosphorylation but slightly increased COX-2 expression and did not alter cPLA2 and annexin 1 expression. These results suggest that the mechanism of shokyo is through the inhibition of cPLA2 activity, and that of kanzo and keihi is through the inhibition of COX-2 activity and indirect inhibition of cPLA2 activity. Therefore, it is possible that shokyo and kakkonto are clinically useful for the improvement of inflammatory responses.

23678818|t|Genoprotective effect of the Chinese herbal decoction xiao jian zhong tang.
23678818|a|The Chinese herbal decoction formula Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (XJZT) is one of the classic formulas from the classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies on XJZT found that it is effective for treating peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, functional gastroenteritis and similar psychosomatic disorders of the digestive organs. It has also been shown that all the herbs used in XJZT contain antioxidants. In this study, we investigated the in vitro DNA protection effect of the individual herb extracts and the whole formula. Water extract of the herbs and XJZT were used to pre-treat human lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were then exposed to hydrogen peroxide. The in vitro DNA protection effect of the herbs was investigated by comet assay. No DNA protective effect (P < 0.05) was found for individual herb extracts, but XJZT showed protection of human lymphocytic DNA upon oxidative stress (P < 0.05). The in vitro DNA protection effect of XJZT was conferred by the synergistic effect of the herbs, while the individual herbs had no such effect.

19680738|t|Simple and rapid analysis of aristolochic acid contained in crude drugs and Kampo formulations with solid-phase extraction and HPLC photodiode-array detection.
19680738|a|Simple and rapid analysis of aristolochic acid (AA) in crude drugs and Kampo extracts using a solid-phase extraction method and HPLC-PDA analysis was investigated. Extraction of AA from samples was accomplished by adding methanol containing 1% ammonia. The addition of ammonia ionized the AA of acidic substances so that they adhered to an acrylamide copolymer of a strong anion exchange resin (Sep-Pak QMA) coupled to diol silica easily. Furthermore, a mixture of acetonitrile-water-phosphoric acid (75:25:2, v/v) was effective in isolating AA from its carrier. Since almost all interfering peaks originating from contaminants in crude drugs and Kampo extract formulations could be removed, a satisfactory HPLC chromatogram of AA was obtained. A good result was also obtained when Aristolochiaceae and crude drugs containing AA were tested. Particularly in the case of the medicinal parts of Asarum, several interfering peaks and a ghost peak detected near the AA peak were eliminated. The AA contents of two Kampo extract formulations, tokishigyakukagoshuyushokyoto and ryutanshakanto, were calculated by HPLC analysis. The AA content (the sum of AA-I and AA-II) was 1.25-6.13 mg per daily dose. From an additional recovery experiment for Kampo formulations, high recovery rates of AA were obtained. Neither LC/MS nor special instrumentation was necessary. Our results suggest that this simple, quick, and sensitive analytical method to detect AA in crude drugs and Kampo extract formulations would be valuable in safety inspections of AA in crude drugs and their products.

11860402|t|Antioxidant effects of herbal therapies used by patients with inflammatory bowel disease: an in vitro study.
11860402|a|BACKGROUND: Herbal remedies used by patients for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease include slippery elm, fenugreek, devil's claw, Mexican yam, tormentil and wei tong ning, a traditional Chinese medicine. Reactive oxygen metabolites produced by inflamed colonic mucosa may be pathogenic. Aminosalicylates (5-ASA) are antioxidant and other such agents could be therapeutic. AIMS: To assess the antioxidant effects of herbal remedies in cell-free oxidant-generating systems and inflamed human colorectal biopsies. METHODS: Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence in a xanthine/xanthine oxidase cell-free system was used to detect superoxide scavenging by herbs and 5-ASA, and fluorimetry to define peroxyl radical scavenging using a phycoerythrin degradation assay. Chemiluminescence was used to detect herbal effects on generation of oxygen radicals by mucosal biopsies from patients with active ulcerative colitis. RESULTS: Like 5-ASA, all herbs, except fenugreek, scavenged superoxide dose-dependently. All materials tested scavenged peroxyl dose-dependently. Oxygen radical release from biopsies was reduced after incubation in all herbs except Mexican yam, and by 5-ASA. CONCLUSIONS: All six herbal remedies have antioxidant effects. Fenugreek is not a superoxide scavenger, while Mexican yam did not inhibit radical generation by inflamed biopsies. Slippery elm, fenugreek, devil's claw, tormentil and wei tong ning merit formal evaluation as novel therapies in inflammatory bowel disease.

24078823|t|Effectiveness of traditional Japanese herbal (kampo) medicine, daiobotanpito, in combination with antibiotic therapy in the treatment of acute diverticulitis: a preliminary study.
24078823|a|In traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine, daiobotanpito (DBT) or Da Huang Mu Dan Tang in Chinese has been used in medical treatment of acute diverticulitis for many years based on the experience. Our aim was to investigate whether the treatment of acute diverticulitis can be treated with intravenous antibiotics plus orally administrated DBT than intravenous antibiotics alone. A retrospective nonrandomized open-label trial was established to compare patients with acute diverticulitis who received oral DBT associated with intravenous antibiotics with those who received intravenous antibiotic alone. We included 34 patients, eleven patients in group 1 with DBT and 23 patients in group 2 without DBT. Both groups were comparable in patient demographics and clinical characteristics. There was a significantly better outcome in the group treated with DBT than in the group without DBT when comparing duration of fever, abdominal pain, and antibiotics administration. A trend toward a day shorter mean hospital stay and fasting was seen in group 1, although this did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, most patients with acute diverticulitis can be managed safely with oral DBT. Although randomized, double-blind study must be done, we could show the possibility to use daiobotanpito as an additional option in treating acute diverticulitis.

20803480|t|Effects of yokukansan and donepezil on learning disturbance and aggressiveness induced by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid b protein in mice.
20803480|a|The effects of yokukansan and donepezil on learning disturbance and aggressiveness were examined in amyloid b protein (Ab)-injected mice. Intellicage tests showed that both yokukansan and donepezil ameliorated Ab-induced learning disturbance, but the ameliorating effect of donepezil was not enhanced by concomitant administration of yokukansan. On the other hand, a social interaction test showed that Ab-induced aggressiveness was ameliorated by yokukansan, but not by donepezil. Co-administration of both drugs also ameliorated aggressiveness, as did yokukansan alone. In vitro binding assays revealed that yokukansan did not bind to choline receptors or transporters. In vitro enzyme assays revealed that yokukansan did not affect choline acetyltransferase activity or inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity, as did donepezil. These results suggest that yokukansan might ameliorate aggressiveness without interfering with the pharmacological efficacy (antidementia effect) of donepezil and also that concomitant administration of yokukansan might be useful for amelioration of aggressiveness, which was not lessened by donepezil. The difference in the efficacies of both drugs may be due to a difference in their pharmacological mechanisms.

23838475|t|Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook contribute to protective effect of traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan against amyloid b oligomer-induced neuronal death.
23838475|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, composed of seven medicinal herbs has been traditionally used to treat neurosis, insomnia, and night crying and irritability in children. Recently, this medicine has been reported to improve the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) that often become problematic in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AIM OF THE STUDY: Amyloid b (Ab) oligomers, which are extremely toxic to neurons, are involved in neurodegeneration in AD. In animals, yokukansan has been proven to improve memory impairments and BPSD-like behavior in transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein and mice intracerebroventricularly injected with Ab oligomers. These results suggest that yokukansan is potentially able to reduce the neurotoxicity of Ab oligomers. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the improving effects brought by yokukansan that consists of seven herbs for Ab oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and to identify the candidate herbs in yokukansan's action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary cultured rat cortical neurons were used. Neurotoxicity induced by Ab oligomers (3  M) and improving effects of yokukansan (300-1000   g/mL) and its constituent herbs were evaluated in MTT assay, DNA fragmentation analysis, and electron microscopic analysis at 48h after treatment with Ab oligomers and drugs. Moreover, changes in expression of genes related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and in caspase-3 activity that is the enzyme closely related to apoptosis were analyzed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Yokukansan ameliorated Ab oligomer-induced neuronal damage in a dose-dependent manner in the MTT assay. This drug also suppressed DNA fragmentation caused by Ab oligomers. Electron microscopic analysis suggested that yokukansan reduced karyopyknosis and the expansion of rough ER caused by Ab oligomers. However, neither Ab oligomers nor yokukansan affected the mRNA expression of any ER stress-related genes, including CHOP and GRP78. On the other hand, yokukansan dose-dependently suppressed Ab oligomer-induced activation of caspase-3. Among the seven constituents of yokukansan, Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook (60-200   g/mL) suppressed Ab oligomer-induced neuronal damage, DNA fragmentation, karyopyknosis, and caspase-3 activation to almost the same extent as yokukansan. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that yokukansan possesses an ameliorative effect against Ab oligomer-induced neuronal apoptosis through the suppression of caspase-3 activation. Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook may, at least in part, contribute to the neuroprotective effect of yokukansan. These mechanisms may underlie the improving effects of yokukansan on memory impairment and BPSD-like behaviors induced by Ab oligomers.

25022209|a|Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, has been used for the management of neurodegenerative disorders and for the treatment of neurosis, insomnia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Recently, several studies have shown that yokukansan has a neuroprotective effect. The aim of this study was to examine the neuroprotective effect of yokukansan on hippocampal neurons from embryonic mouse brain against the effects of corticosterone, which is considered to be a stress hormone and to be cytotoxic toward neurons. The cell survival rates were measured by the WST-8 assay and LDH assay. Twenty-four hours after treatment with corticosterone, cell numbers were significantly decreased compared with the control or treatment with vehicle in a dose-dependent manner. When cells were treated with 30  M corticosterone, the decrease in the number of cells was significantly recovered by treatment with yokukansan (100-1,000  g/ml) in a dose-dependent manner. However, yokukansan did not suppress the decrease in cell numbers that was induced by treatment with 100  M corticosterone. In the LDH assay, treatment with yokukansan at a high concentration (500-1,000  g/ml) suppressed the LDH concentration induced by treatment with both 30  M and 100  M corticosterone compared to treatment with corticosterone alone, respectively. These results suggest that yokukansan protects against the cytotoxic effect of a low concentration of corticosterone on hippocampal neurons.

26681968|t|Yokukansan Increases 5-HT1A Receptors in the Prefrontal Cortex and Enhances 5-HT1A Receptor Agonist-Induced Behavioral Responses in Socially Isolated Mice.
26681968|a|The traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan has an anxiolytic effect, which occurs after repeated administration. In this study, to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the effects of repeated yokukansan administration on serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor density and affinity and its expression at both mRNA and protein levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of socially isolated mice. Moreover, we examined the effects of yokukansan on a 5-HT1A receptor-mediated behavioral response. Male mice were subjected to social isolation stress for 6 weeks and simultaneously treated with yokukansan. Thereafter, the density and affinity of 5-HT1A receptors were analyzed by a receptor-binding assay. Levels of 5-HT1A receptor protein and mRNA were also measured. Furthermore, (  )-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; a 5-HT1A receptor agonist) was injected intraperitoneally, and rearing behavior was examined. Social isolation stress alone did not affect 5-HT1A receptor density or affinity. However, yokukansan significantly increased receptor density and decreased affinity concomitant with unchanged protein and mRNA levels. Yokukansan also enhanced the 8-OH-DPAT-induced decrease in rearing behavior. These results suggest that yokukansan increases 5-HT1A receptors in the PFC of socially isolated mice and enhances their function, which might underlie its anxiolytic effects.

25732836|t|Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, decreases head-twitch behaviors and serotonin 2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex of isolation-stressed mice.
25732836|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has recently been used to treat the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including aggressiveness, excitability, and hallucination. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effects of yokukansan on BPSD using animals exhibiting hallucination-like behaviors. For this purpose, we initially examined whether chronic isolation stress increases the frequency of hallucination in response to a psychedelic drug. Using this animal model, we next examined the effects of yokukansan on drug-induced hallucination-like behaviors. Finally, we examined the density and mRNA levels of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male mice were subjected to isolation stress for six weeks. Yokukansan was incorporated into food pellets, and administered to the mice for six weeks. In some experiments, yokukansan and each of seven constituent herbs were administered orally to the mice for the last two weeks during the six-week period of isolation stress. A 5-HT2A receptor agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI, 2.5mg/kg), was injected into the mice, and head-twitch behaviors were quantified. The binding sites of 5-HT2A receptors on the plasma membrane of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were assessed by a receptor-binding assay using tritium-labeled ketanserin, and the density and affinity were calculated from a Scatchard plot. The level of mRNAs was measured by PCR analyses. RESULTS: Isolation stress enhanced the frequency of the DOI-induced head-twitch response, and yokukansan treatment by feeding significantly reduced this enhancement. Isolation stress significantly increased the 5-HT2A receptor density in the PFC, and yokukansan treatment by feeding as well as administration significantly down-regulated this increase. Isolation stress and yokukansan did not affect the affinity. Among seven constituent herbs, Bupleurum Root, Uncaria Hook, Japanese Angelica Root, and Glycyrrhiza down-regulated the increase, in which their efficacies were over 50% relative to yokukansan. Neither isolation stress nor yokukansan affected mRNA levels of 5-HT2A receptors. CONCLUSION: Yokukansan attenuated drug-induced hallucination-like behaviors in isolated mice, which is suggested to be mediated by 5-HT2A receptor down-regulation in the PFC. This mechanism may underlie the ameliorative effects of yokukansan on hallucination.

23770052|t|Brain region-specific reduction in c-Fos expression associated with an anxiolytic effect of yokukansan in rats.
23770052|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: A traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, yokukansan, has long been used to treat neurosis, insomnia, and night crying and irritability in children. Recently, this medicine has reported to improve the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia that often become problematic in patients with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. AIM OF THE STUDY: Several animal studies have reported that yokukansan has an anxiolytic effect. However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects in rats of single and repeated administrations of yokukansan on anxiety-like behaviors, stress responses, and the brain regions involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Yokukansan dissolved in water (100 or 300 mg/kg) was administered orally to F344/N male rats 1h before each test or for two weeks before the tests began. Locomotor activity and anxiety-related behavior in the open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test, serum corticosterone levels, and restraint stress-induced c-Fos expression in various brain regions as a marker of neuronal activation were evaluated in both the vehicle-treated and yokukansan-treated rats. RESULTS: A single administration of yokukansan had no effect on locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior; however, repeated administration decreased anxiety-like behavior in a dose-dependent manner. Neither single nor repeated administration of yokukansan had an effect on the basal or stress-induced levels of serum corticosterone. For c-Fos expression, restraint stress increased the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Repeated administration of yokukansan decreased the stress-induced c-Fos expression in the prelimbic cortex and the basolateral and medial amygdaloid nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that repeated oral administration of yokukansan has an anxiolytic effect and that this effect may be associated with attenuated neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala.

19703376|t|Effect of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on social and aggressive behaviour of para-chloroamphetamine-injected rats.
19703376|a|OBJECTIVES: Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, has been approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan as a remedy for neurosis, insomnia or night crying and irritability in children. It has recently been reported to improve behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, such as hallucinations, agitation, and aggressiveness in patients with some forms of senile dementia. Little is known about the mechanism underlying the effectiveness of yokukansan. Our aim was to clarify the involvement of yokukansan in serotonergic function in para-chloroamphetamine (PCA)-induced aggressive behaviour in rats. METHODS: The effect of yokukansan on social interactions, including social and aggressive behaviour, was examined in PCA-injected rats. Concentration and release level of serotonin (5-HT) in the hypothalamus were measured. KEY FINDINGS: PCA reduced not only the 5-HT concentration but also the high K(+)-induced 5-HT release in the rat hypothalamus. Social interaction tests showed a significant decrease in social behaviour and a significant increase in aggressive behaviour in the PCA-treated rats. The decrease in social behaviour was ameliorated by the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone and further decreased by a 5-HT1A antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclo-hexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY-100635), whereas it was further decreased by the 5-HT2A agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), and ameliorated by the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin. On the other hand, the increase in aggressive behaviour was ameliorated by buspirone but not affected by WAY-100635, whereas it was enhanced by DOI and ameliorated by ketanserin. A single injection of yokukansan ameliorated the PCA-induced decrease in social behaviour but not aggressive behaviour. Chronic treatment for 14 days with yokukansan ameliorated PCA-induced abnormal behaviour, decreased social behaviour and increased aggressive behaviour, but it did not ameliorate PCA-induced decreases in the cerebral 5-HT concentration and 5-HT release. The ameliorative effects of chronic yokukansan on behaviour were counteracted by co-administration of WAY-100635. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that yokukansan might have two different effects: an acute effect on social behaviour and a chronic effect on aggressive behaviour. One of the mechanisms of these effects of yokukansan may be related to the agonistic effect on 5-HT1A receptors.

27497482|t|Yokukansan in the Treatment of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia: An Updated Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
27497482|a|BACKGROUND: Previous clinical studies found that yokukansan has a therapeutic effect on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in dementia patients. OBJECTIVE: To perform an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing yokukansan for patients with BPSD. METHODS: Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were BPSD total scores and all-cause discontinuation, respectively. Secondary outcomes were BPSD subscales, cognitive function scores [Mini-mental state examination (MMSE)], activities of daily living (ADL) scores, discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), and incidences of AEs. RESULTS: Five RCTs with 381 patients with BPSD were included. Compared with controls [placebo+usual care (UC)], yokukansan significantly decreased BPSD total scores [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.53 to -0.11, p=0.003, I2=0%, N=5 studies, n=361]. Yokukansan was more efficacious in reducing BPSD subscale scores (delusions: SMD=-0.51, 95% CI=-0.98 to -0.04, hallucinations: SMD=-0.54, 95% CI=-0.96 to -0.12, agitation/aggression: SMD=-0.37, 95% CI=-0.60 to -0.15) than placebo+UC. However, yokukansan was not superior to placebo+UC for BPSD total as well as any subscales scores only in Alzheimer's disease patients. Compared with UC, yokukansan treatment improved ADL scores (SMD=-0.32, 95% CI=-0.62 to -0.01). MMSE scores did not differ between the yokukansan and placebo+UC treatment groups. No significant differences were found in all-cause discontinuation, discontinuation due to AEs, and incidences of AEs between yokukansan and placebo+UC treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that yokukansan is beneficial for the treatment of patients with BPSD and is well-tolerated; it was not beneficial for BPSD total and any subscale scores only in Alzheimer's disease patients.

24269335|t|Ameliorative effects of yokukansan on behavioral deficits in a gerbil model of global cerebral ischemia.
24269335|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of yokukansan, a traditional Kampo medicine, on the behavioral dysfunction induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in gerbils. Gerbils were treated with yokukasan by oral gavage for 30 days, once per day, until the day before induction of ischemia, which was induced by occluding the bilateral common carotid artery for 5 min. The effects of yokukansan (50, 100 and 300 mg/kg) were examined by measuring neuronal damage and behavioral deficits (locomotor activity, 8-arm radial maze task). The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of yokukansan were also examined. Administration of yokukansan at 300 mg/kg significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal death after brain ischemia, inhibited the ischemia-induced inflammatory response and DNA oxidative damage. Yokukansan also reduced ischemia-induced locomotor hyperactivity and improved memory impairment. These findings suggest that yokukansan can inhibit the inflammatory response, oxidative damage and subsequent neuronal death induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and also can contribute to improvement in neurological deficits following such injury.

25866544|t|Yokukansan Improves Mechanical Allodynia through the Regulation of Interleukin-6 Expression in the Spinal Cord in Mice with Neuropathic Pain.
25866544|a|Neuropathic pain is caused by nerve injury. Yokukansan (Yi-Gan San), a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has been widely used for neuropathic pain control. However, the analgesic mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the analgesic mechanisms of yokukansan in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. Partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) induced mechanical allodynia in mice. Repetitive oral administration of the extracts of yokukansan and the constituent herbal medicine Atractylodis Lanceae Rhizoma, but not Glycyrrhizae Radix, relieved mechanical allodynia in the PSL mice and inhibited the PSL-induced expression of interleukin- (IL-) 6 mRNA in the spinal cord. Yokukansan did not attenuate intrathecal IL-6-induced mechanical allodynia. IL-6 immunoreactivity was detected in microglia and astrocytes in the spinal dorsal horn. These results suggest that yokukansan relieves mechanical allodynia in PSL mice by regulating the expression of IL-6 in astrocytes and/or microglia in the spinal cord. In addition, the components of Atractylodis Lanceae Rhizoma, one of the constituent herbal medicines in yokukansan, may play an important role in the regulation of IL-6 expression and neuropathic pain control.

19138715|t|Effect of yokukansan on the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease.
19138715|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of yokukansan (YKS) on the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Fifteen patients with AD (mean age: 80.2+/-4.0 years) participated in the study. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used for the assessment of cognitive function. BPSD were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The Barthel Index was used for the assessment for the activities of daily living (ADL). The treatment with YKS along with sulpiride, a dopamine D(2) selective antipsychotic, was performed for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Fourteen patients completed the trial. After the 12 weeks of treatment with YKS, significant improvement of the mean NPI score was observed while no significant improvement was observed in the control group. The average dose of sulpiride at the end of the present study was less in the YKS group than in the control group. The MMSE results did not change either in the YKS group or in the control group. The Barthel Index did not significantly change either in the YKS group or in the control group. No serious adverse effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of the YKS treatment significantly improved BPSD with less antipsychotics in elderly patients with AD. The YKS treatment did not cause any cognitive decline or ADL decline and no serious adverse effects were noted. The present study suggests that YKS is beneficial for the treatment of BPSD and that it can possibly reduce the doses of antipsychotics required for the treatment of BPSD. Further studies with larger patient populations using a double-blind placebo-controlled design should be performed.

24169925|t|An exploratory study of the efficacy and safety of yokukansan for neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease.
24169925|a|The present study examined the efficacy and safety of yokukansan (YKS) in neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). Twenty-five patients with PD (M:F 14:11; age 72 years) were enrolled and treated with YKS (7.5 g/day) for 12 weeks. The NPI was assessed at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. The patient's motor function and progression were evaluated using the Unified PD Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) and Hoehn and Yahr scale, respectively. The serum potassium concentration (sK) and all adverse events were recorded. The median NPI total score significantly decreased from 12 points at baseline to 4.0 points at 12 weeks (p = 0.00003). Within each NPI subscale, significant improvements were observed in hallucinations, anxiety and apathy. These symptoms tended to worsen after the completion of YKS treatment. Delusions, agitation, depression, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor activity tended to improve but irritability showed no change. The median NPI subtotal scores, positive symptoms (delusions-hallucinations-irritability) significantly decreased (p = 0.01660) and negative symptoms (anxiety-apathy) significantly decreased (p = 0.00391). Both UPDRS-III and the Hoehn and Yahr scale showed no significant change. sK decreased mildly from 4.26    0.30 to 4.08    0.33 mEq/L. Two patients showed hypokalemia lower than 3.5 mEq/L without any corresponding symptoms; two patients showed listlessness and one patient showed drug eruption. Each recovered after discontinuation of YKS. YKS improved neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with PD, including hallucinations, anxiety and apathy without severe adverse events and worsening of Parkinsonism.

24799947|t|The effect of the kampo medicine yokukansan on preoperative anxiety and sedation levels.
24799947|a|Background. Preoperative anxiety can lead to unfavorable physiological response such as tachycardia and hypertension. Prevention of preoperative anxiety improves surgical outcome and decreases inpatient stay. Yokukansan is one of prescriptions in Kampo, traditional Japanese herbal medicine, and is known to exert anxiolytic effects. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of diazepam and Yokukansan on preoperative anxiety, salivary amylase activity, and sedation levels. Methods. Seventy American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II patients presenting for hemicolectomy under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia were enrolled. The Diazepam group received diazepam 5   mg orally and the Yokukansan group received Yokukansan 2.5   g orally. Results. Although levels of anxiety and salivary amylase activity were not different between the two groups, the modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale of the Yokukansan group was significantly higher compared to that of the Diazepam group. Conclusion. Yokukansan alleviated preoperative anxiety without undesirable sedation, when compared with diazepam.

25156212|t|Anti-allergic mechanisms of Japanese herbal medicine, yokukansan on mast cells.
25156212|a|We previously reported that the addition of orally administered yokukansan (YKS), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, to the standard regimen using histamine H1-receptor inhibitors was effective in controlling refractory chronic urticaria, but the mechanism remained unknown. YKS has also been reported to be effective on inhibiting the development of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. As known, the release of various chemical mediators including histamine from degranulated mast cells is strongly related to the mechanism of these diseases. Thus the purpose of this study was to examine the mechanisms behind the medicinal effects of YKS on mast cells using an in vitro system and rat basophil leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. The degree of degranulation was measured by b-hexosaminidase secretion assay and intracellular calcium influx assay. ELISA for cytokines (TNF-a and IL-4) was also conducted using cell culture media. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of YKS on the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) and cytokine production (IL-8) in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells using gene-transcriptional- and immunohisotoligical analysis. We found that YKS inhibited secretion of b-hexosaminidase, intracellular calcium increase, production of TNF-a and ICAM-1 expression, and that several YKS ingredients may be the key effectors. In conclusion, YKS may suppress several mast cell functions such as degranulation and calcium increase that eventually inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, YKS suppresses ICAM-1 expression on human microvascular endothelial cells. These findings may promote our understanding of the beneficial effects of YKS on mast cell-associated allergic diseases.

21152992|t|Effects of yokukansan on anxiety-like behavior in a rat model of cerebrovascular dementia.
21152992|a|Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are commonly seen in patients with dementia. Current pharmacological approaches to treatment are inadequate, despite the availability of serotonergic agents to ameliorate anxiety, one of the symptoms of BPSD. The herbal medicine yokukansan has been demonstrated to improve BPSD in a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study. However, the mechanisms of the anxiolytic effect of yokukansan have not been clarified. There are also no reports on the anxiolytic effect of yokukansan in cerebrovascular ischemia models. In this study, we examined whether rats subjected to repeated cerebral ischemia exhibited anxiety-like behavior in a plus-maze task, a light/dark box test and an open-field task. We then investigated the effect of yokukansan on anxiety-like behavior in ischemic rats. Repeated ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion method in which a 10-min ischemic episode was repeated once after 60 min. Yokukansan was orally administered once a day for 14 days from 7 days before ischemia induction. The last administration was performed 1 h before the behavioral experiments. The ischemic rats showed anxiety-like behavior in all three tasks, suggesting that this rat may be a good model for anxiety in cerebrovascular dementia. Yokukansan exhibited anxiolytic effects on the anxiety-like behavior in rats subjected to repeated cerebral ischemia, and exerted antagonistic effects on the wet-dog shakes induced by 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-indophenyl)-2-amino propane, a serotonin receptor (5-HT(2A)) agonist. This study revealed that yokukansan shows anxiolytic effects not only in normal animals but also in cerebrovascular model rats.

21513784|t|Ameliorative effects of yokukansan on learning and memory deficits in olfactory bulbectomized mice.
21513784|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: Yokukansan (YKS) is a Japanese traditional herbal medicine and has been used for the treatment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The present study aimed to clarify the effects of YKS on learning and memory impairments, and its mechanisms of action in olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice, one of the animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: OBX or sham-operated ddY mice were treated with YKS or donepezil (DPZ), a reference drug, and their cognitive performances were tested by the modified Y-maze test, novel object recognition test, and fear conditioning test to elucidate the spatial working memory, non-spatial short-term memory, and long-term memory, respectively. After completing the behavioral experiments, the expression level of cholinergic marker proteins and the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain were analyzed by western blotting and Ellman's method, respectively. RESULTS: OBX caused spatial working memory and non-spatial working memory impairments that were reversed by YKS and also by DPZ; however, YKS failed to affect the long-term memory deficits. Amelioration of the spatial working memory by YKS was reversible by scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. YKS treatment reversed OBX-induced down-regulation of choline acetyltransferase and muscarinic muscarinic M    receptor expression without affecting muscarinic M    receptor expression or AChE activity. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that YKS improves short-term memory deficit caused by OBX and that the effect is at least partly mediated by muscarinic receptor stimulation and the normalization of central cholinergic systems. The present findings also suggest that YKS has a therapeutic effect not only on BPSD, but also on memory impairment of AD.

21691759|t|Isoliquiritigenin is a novel NMDA receptor antagonist in kampo medicine yokukansan.
21691759|a|Effects of a traditional Japanese medicine, yokukansan, which is composed of seven medicinal herbs, on glutamate-induced cell death were examined using primary cultured rat cortical neurons. Yokukansan (10-300  g/ml) inhibited the 100  M glutamate-induced neuronal death in a concentration-dependent manner. Among seven constituent herbs, higher potency of protection was found in Uncaria thorn (UT) and Glycyrrhiza root (GR). A similar neuroprotective effect was found in four components (geissoschizine methyl ether, hirsuteine, hirsutine, and rhynchophylline) in UT and four components (glycycoumarin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritin, and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid) in GR. In the NMDA receptor binding and receptor-linked Ca(2+) influx assays, only isoliquiritigenin bound to NMDA receptors and inhibited the glutamate-induced increase in Ca(2+) influx. Glycycoumarin and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid bound to NMDA receptors, but did not inhibit the Ca(2+) influx. The four UT-derived components did not bind to NMDA receptors. The present results suggest that neuroprotective components (isoliquiritigenin, glycycoumarin, liquiritin, and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid in GR and geissoschizine methyl ether, hirsuteine, hirsutine, and rhynchophylline in UT) are contained in yokukansan, and isoliquiritigenin, which is one of them, is a novel NMDA receptor antagonist.

27373856|t|Neuropharmacological efficacy of the traditional Japanese Kampo medicine yokukansan and its active ingredients.
27373856|a|UNASSIGNED: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive dysfunction, and is often complicated by behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) including excitement, aggression, and hallucinations. Typical and atypical antipsychotics are used for the treatment of BPSD, but induce adverse events. The traditional Japanese Kampo medicine yokukansan (YKS), which had been originated from the traditional Chinese medicine Yi-Gan-San, has been reported to improve BPSD without severe adverse effects. In the preclinical basic studies, there are over 70 research articles indicating the neuropharmacological efficacies of YKS. In this review, we first describe the neuropharmacological actions of YKS and its bioactive ingredients. Multiple potential actions for YKS were identified, which include effects on serotonergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission as well as neuroprotection, anti-stress effect, promotion of neuroplasticity, and anti-inflammatory effect. Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) in Uncaria hook and 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) in Glycyrrhiza were responsible for several pharmacological actions of YKS. Subsequently, we describe the pharmacokinetics of GM and GA in rats. These ingredients were absorbed into the blood, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and reached the brain, in rats orally administered YKS. Moreover, autoradiography showed that [(3)H]GM predominantly distributed in the frontal cortex and [(3)H]GA in hippocampus. Thus, YKS is a versatile herbal remedy with a variety of neuropharmacological effects, and may operate as a multicomponent drug including various active ingredients.

20594286|t|Effectiveness of Japanese herbal medicine yokukansan for alleviating psychiatric symptoms after traumatic brain injury.
20594286|a|The Japanese herbal medicine, yokukansan, has been reported to improve behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and activities of daily living in patients with dementia. In the present case report, the authors report the effectiveness of yokukansan in treating psychiatric symptoms after traumatic brain injury. An 85-year-old man, who underwent surgery for hepatic portal cholangiocarcinoma, sustained traumatic brain injury after falling from bed as the result of postoperative delirium. He subsequently presented with psychiatric symptoms, showing markedly impulsive and aggressive behavior. Neuroleptics did not alleviate the symptoms. Ultimately, we succeeded in controlling the symptoms, without adverse effects, by giving the patient yokukansan. Yokukansan shows the potential for reducing aggressive and impulsive behavior in dementia as well as in other psychiatric diseases.

23055705|t|New possibility of traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine as treatment for behavioral and psychiatric symptoms in dementia.
23055705|a|Yokukansan, one of the Kampo prescriptions, is composed of seven herbaceous plants and was developed in China in the 16th century as a cure for restlessness and agitation in children. Yokukansan has also become a popular drug combination in Japan, especially for the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Recent studies have shown that yokukansan might also be quite effective against BPSD occurring in association with other types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Researchers have intensively investigated yokukansan, focusing on the pharmacological mechanisms against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. This traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine holds potential promise for improving BPSD in elderly patients suffering from dementia.

19165748|t|Effects of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on aggressiveness induced by intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid beta protein into mice.
19165748|a|The effects of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on aggressiveness and motor activities were examined in mice after injection of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) into the lateral ventricle of the brain. The results were compared with those of conventional (haloperidol) and atypical (risperidone) antipsychotic medicines. A significant increase in aggressiveness was observed on day 7 after injection of Abeta, and it lasted until day 28. A single oral administration of yokukansan (1.0 g/kg) did not ameliorate the aggressiveness observed on day 7. However, a tendency toward amelioration of the aggressiveness was observed after the administration of yokukansan (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) for 1 week (days 7-14). The 3 week administration (days 7-28) of yokukansan significantly ameliorated the aggressiveness in a dose-dependent manner without inhibition of motor activity. In contrast, a single administration of intraperitoneal haloperidol (0.03-0.1 mg/kg) or oral risperidone (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) on day 28 significantly reduced aggressiveness in a dose-dependent manner. However, motor activities were significantly suppressed. These results suggest yokukansan reduces aggressiveness without suppressing physical activity.

21442303|t|The blood-brain barrier permeability of geissoschizine methyl ether in Uncaria hook, a galenical constituent of the traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan.
21442303|a|Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) in Uncaria hook, a galenical constituent of yokukansan is thought to be one of active components in the psychotropic effect of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo medicine). However, there is no data on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of Uncaria hook-derived alkaloids containing GM. In this study, we investigated the BBB permeability of seven Uncaria hook alkaloids (GM, isocorynoxeine, isorhynchophylline, hirsuteine, hirsutine, rhynchophylline, and corynoxeine) using in vivo and in vitro methods. In the in vivo experiment, seven alkaloids in the plasma and brain of rats orally administered with yokukansan were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy/mass spectrometric multiple reaction monitoring assay. In the in vitro experiment, the BBB permeability of seven alkaloids were examined using the BBB model composed of co-culture of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. In the in vivo study, six components containing GM but not isocorynoxeine were detected in the plasma, and three (GM, hirsuteine, and corynoxeine) of components were detected in the brain. The in vitro BBB permeability data indicated that seven alkaloids were able to cross brain endothelial cells in culture conditions and that the BBB permeability of GM was higher than those of the other six alkaloids. These results suggest that target ingredient GM in yokukansan administered orally is absorbed into the blood and then reaches the brain through the BBB. This evidence further supports the possibility that GM is an active component in the psychotropic effect of yokukansan.

19079814|t|A randomized cross-over study of a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo), yokukansan, in the treatment of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.
19079814|a|The effectiveness and safety of yokukansan (TJ-54), a traditional Japanese medicine (kampo) for the treatment of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), were evaluated in 106 patients diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease (AD) (including mixed-type dementia) or dementia with Lewy bodies. Patients were randomly assigned to group A (TJ-54 treatment in period I and no treatment in period II; each period lasting 4 wk) or group B (no treatment in period I and TJ-54 treatment in period II). BPSD and cognitive functions were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Activities of daily living (ADL) were evaluated using Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) in outpatients and the Barthel Index in in-patients. For the safety evaluation, adverse events were investigated. Significant improvements in mean total NPI score associated with TJ-54 treatment were observed in both periods (Wilcoxon test, p=0.040 in period I and p=0.048 in period II). The mean NPI scores significantly improved during TJ-54 treatment in groups A and B (p=0.002 and p=0.007, respectively) but not during periods of no treatment. Among the NPI subscales, significant improvements were observed in delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression, anxiety, and irritability/lability. The effects of TJ-54 persisted for 1 month without any psychological withdrawal symptoms in group A. TJ-54 did not show any effect on either cognitive function or ADL. No serious adverse reactions were observed. The present study suggests that TJ-54 is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with BPSD.

19146938|t|Ameliorative effects of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on learning and non-cognitive disturbances in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
19146938|a|AIM OF THIS STUDY: Aim of the present study is to clarify the effects of yokukansan (TJ-54) on learning and non-cognitive disturbances in the Tg2576 mouse expressing the human form of the APP695SWE (APP-Tg mice), which is considered to be an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Powdered diets containing 0.5 and 1.0% TJ-54 were given to the mice for 10 months (from 5 to 15 months old). The Morris water-maze test, elevated plus-maze test, and open-field test were performed for evaluation of learning and non-cognitive disturbances. RESULTS: Treatment with 1.0% TJ-54 for 5 months shortened the time it took for APP-Tg positive (+) mice to reach the platform in the Morris water-maze test. In the elevated plus-maze test, treatment with 1.0% TJ-54 for 2 months significantly reduced the increased number of entries and the time spent in open arms observed in APP-Tg(+) mice. In an open-field test, treatment of 1.0% TJ-54 for 9 months significantly suppressed the increase in locomotion observed in APP-Tg(+) mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the possibility that TJ-54 ameliorates learning deficits and non-cognitive defects including a decrease in the anxiety (or disinhibition) and an increase in locomotor activity (hyperactivity) observed in APP-Tg(+) mice.

19409210|t|Neuroprotective effects of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in cultured cells.
19409210|a|To clarify the mechanism of yokukansan (TJ-54), a traditional Japanese medicine, against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, the effects of TJ-54 on glutamate uptake function were first examined using cultured rat cortical astrocytes. Under thiamine-deficient conditions, the uptake of glutamate into astrocytes, and the levels of proteins and mRNA expressions of glutamate aspartate transporter of astrocytes significantly decreased. These decreases were ameliorated in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with TJ-54 (100-700 microg/ml). The improvement of glutamate uptake with TJ-54 was completely blocked by the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid. Effects of TJ-54 on glutamate-induced neuronal death were next examined by using cultured PC12 cells as a model for neurons. Addition of 17.5 mM glutamate to the culture medium induced an approximately 50% cell death, as evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. TJ-54 (1-1000 microg/ml) inhibited the cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, competitive binding assays to glutamate receptors showed that TJ-54 bound potently to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, in particular, to its glutamate and glycine recognition sites. These results suggest that TJ-54 may exert a neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity not only by amelioration of dysfunction of astrocytes but also by direct protection of neuronal cells.

23948783|t|Efficacy and tolerability of risperidone, yokukansan, and fluvoxamine for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: a blinded, randomized trial.
23948783|a|The descriptive term behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is used to cover a range of noncognitive disturbances including anxiety, depression, irritability, aggression, agitation, eating disorders, and inappropriate social or sexual behaviors. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are seen in about 90% of patients with dementia. We aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone, yokukansan, and fluvoxamine used for BPSD in elderly patients with dementia. Ninety inpatients with dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria were investigated in Sato Hospital, Koutokukai. We conducted an 8-week, rater-blinded, randomized trial, administering flexibly dosed risperidone, yokukansan, or fluvoxamine. Primary outcome measures were Neuropsychiatric Inventory in Nursing Home Version total score and its items. Secondary outcome measures were cognitive function measured by Mini-Mental State Examination and daily life function measured by Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Neurological adverse effects were measured by the Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale. At the end of the study, we analyzed 76 patients (92.7%). Mean Neuropsychiatric Inventory in Nursing Home Version total score decreased in all 3 drug groups, with no significant between-group differences. Mini-Mental State Examination and Functional Independence Measure scores did not change significantly. Drug-Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale scores did not change in the yokukansan and fluvoxamine groups, but increased significantly in the risperidone group. Risperidone, yokukansan, and fluvoxamine were equally effective in the treatment of BPSD in elderly patients. However, yokukansan or fluvoxamine for BPSD showed a more favorable profile in tolerability compared with risperidone. This trial is registered at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (identifier: UMIN000006146).

24204394|t|Potential usefulness of the kampo medicine yokukansan, containing uncaria hook, for paediatric emotional and behavioural disorders: a case series.
24204394|a|Background. Paediatric emotional and behavioural disorders (EBD) are relatively common diseases. Although nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments are utilized in these cases, it is sometimes difficult to manage the symptoms of EBD. Historically, Uncaria hook has been used for treating nighttime crying and convulsions in children. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that the Kampo medicine Yokukansan (YKS), which contains Uncaria hook, is efficacious for behaviour disorders in Alzheimer's disease patients. Herein, we investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of YKS in a series of cases with paediatric EBD. Patients and Methods. We retrospectively reviewed all paediatric patients who sought Japanese Kampo therapy at our outpatient clinics between April 1, 2012, and April 30, 2013; we selected patients who were diagnosed with paediatric EBD and were treated with YKS. Results. After screening all candidates, 3 patients were eligible for this analysis. Their average age was 11.6 years (range 10-13 years). All 3 patients responded very well to YKS within 1 month. No drug-related adverse events were observed during the course of YKS treatment. Conclusion. Yokukansan may be efficacious for paediatric EBD. We believe these results warrant further evaluation of the clinical efficacy and safety of Yokukansan for paediatric EBD in a carefully designed, double-blind, randomized clinical study.

23279145|t|Improvement in delusions and hallucinations in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies upon administration of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine.
23279145|a|BACKGROUND: This multicentre open-label trial examined the efficacy and safety of the traditional Japanese medicine, or Kampo medicine, yokukansan (YKS), for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. METHODS: Sixty-three dementia with Lewy bodies patients with probable BPSD (M:W, 30:33; mean age, 78.2  5.8 years) were enrolled and treated with YKS for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Significant improvements in Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores (mean decrease, 12.5 points; P<0.001) and Zarit Burden Interview-Japanese edition tests (mean decrease, 3.6 points; P=0.024) were observed. In patients who consented to an assessment after 2 weeks of treatment, a time-dependent significant improvement was observed in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (n=23; mean decrease, 14.4; P<0.001), each subscale, including delusions and hallucinations, the Zarit Burden Interview-Japanese edition (n=22; mean decrease, 8.2; P<0.01) and the behavioural pathology in Alzheimer's disease insomnia subscale. The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) showed no significant change. Adverse events were observed in 11 (18%) patients. Three patients (5%) discontinued YKS due to adverse reactions, namely, spasticity and exacerbation of BPSD, edema, and nausea. Hypokalaemia (<3.5 mEq/L) was present in four patients (6%) at the study endpoint. Worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms was not observed. CONCLUSION: YKS improved BPSD in dementia with Lewy bodies patients and caregiver burden scores without deterioration in cognitive function. YKS is useful for the treatment of delusions and hallucinations in BPSD.

19913081|t|Partial agonistic effect of yokukansan on human recombinant serotonin 1A receptors expressed in the membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells.
19913081|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional Japanese medicine consisted of seven medicinal herbs and has been used for treatment of neurosis, insomnia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in Japan. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the present study is to clarify the intrinsic activity of YKS on serotonin (5-HT)1A and 5-HT2A receptors and also to determine the constituent herbs which are responsible for the effect of YKS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dry powdered extracts of YKS, seven constituent herbs, and YKS-analogues which were produced by eliminating one of the constituent herbs from YKS in the manufacturing process, were used for the evaluation. Competitive binding assays for 5-HT receptors and [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assays for the evaluation of agonistic/antagonistic activity were performed using Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes stably expressing human recombinant 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A receptors. RESULTS: YKS (6.25-400 microg/ml) concentration-dependently inhibited the binding of [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT to 5-HT1A receptors. The IC(50) value was estimated to be 61.2 microg/ml. In contrast, YKS failed to inhibit the binding of [(3)H]ketanserin to 5-HT2A receptors. Only Uncaria hook (3.13-50 microg/ml), of the seven constituent herbal extracts, inhibited the [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT binding to 5-HT1A receptors in a concentration-dependent manner, and the IC(50) value was estimated to be 7.42 microg/ml. The extracts of YKS or Uncaria hook increased [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding to 5-HT1A receptors to approximately 50% of that of a full agonist, 5-HT. Both the competitive binding and [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding of YKS to 5-HT1A receptors were remarkably attenuated by eliminating Uncaria hook from YKS, but it was almost unchanged when one of the other constituent herbs was eliminated from YKS. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that YKS has a partial agonistic effect on 5-HT1A receptors, which is mainly attributed to Uncaria hook.

21195139|t|Ameliorative effect of traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan on age-related impairments of working memory and reversal learning in rats.
21195139|a|Aging is thought to impair prefrontal cortical (PFC) structure-sensitive cognitive functions and flexibility, such as working memory and reversal learning. A traditional Japanese medicine, yokukansan (YKS), is frequently used to treat age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease in Japan, but its pharmacological properties have not been elucidated. The present study was designed to examine whether YKS improves age-related cognitive deficits using aged rats. YKS was administered to 21-month-old rats for 3 months. The ability to learn initially a reward rule for a T-maze discrimination task (initial learning) was examined in young control (4-month-old), aged control (24-month-old) and YKS-treated aged (24-month-old) rats. Subsequently, working memory and reversal learning were examined in delayed alternation and reversal discrimination T-maze tasks, respectively. Locomotor activity was also measured in new environments. Although performance accuracy in the initial learning procedure did not differ among any experimental groups, accuracy in the delayed alternation task was significantly decreased in aged rats compared to young rats. Aged rats also showed significant decreases in accuracy in the reversal discrimination task. YKS treatment significantly ameliorated the age-related decreases in accuracy in the delayed alternation and reversal discrimination tasks. The ameliorative effects of YKS on impaired delayed alternation performance were reduced by intracranial infusions of a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, into the prelimbic cortical region of the PFC, and the YKS effects on impaired reversal learning were done by the infusions into the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Locomotor activity did not change in any experimental group. Thus, YKS ameliorated age-related impairments of working memory and reversal learning, which might be mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism in the PFC structure. These investigations provide information important for the treatment of brain dysfunctions in the elderly people.

19799980|t|Anxiolytic effect of a herbal medicine, yokukansan, in aged rats: involvement of serotonergic and dopaminergic transmissions in the prefrontal cortex.
19799980|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: Aging is thought to affect emotions including anxiety, and a herbal medicine, yokukansan (YKS), is used to treat emotional disturbances associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, but its pharmacological properties have not been fully understood. The present study was designed to examine whether YKS improves age-related anxiety using F344/N aged rats. Moreover, the effects of YKS on liver function were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: YKS was administered to 21-month-old aged rats for 3 months. Locomotor activity of young control (4 months old), aged control (24 months old), and YKS-treated aged rats was examined, and the anxiety-related responses of these animals were evaluated by counting the number of excrements during locomotor activity measurement and in the elevated plus-maze test. The extracellular concentrations of serotonin and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were also measured using a microdialysis technique. Moreover, concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and ammonia (NH(3)) in plasma were measured. RESULTS: Although locomotor activity did not change among any experimental groups, the number of excrements was significantly increased in aged rats compared to young rats, and this increase was significantly improved by YKS treatment. Aged rats also showed significant decreases in time and frequency in the open arm of the elevated plus-maze, and these decreases were significantly improved by YKS treatment. Extracellular concentrations of serotonin and dopamine in the aged PFC were significantly decreased; serotonin was increased over the level of young rats and dopamine was partially improved by YKS treatment, respectively. In addition, YKS improved age-related increase in NH(3) concentration, but did not affect AST and ALT. CONCLUSIONS: YKS has improving activity for age-related increased anxiety and enhances serotonergic and dopaminergic transmissions in the aged PFC. These mechanisms provide information important for the treatment of anxiety in the elderly. Furthermore, the present data confirm partially the Kampo concept "liver disease".

19801831|t|Effects of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on memory disturbance and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in thiamine-deficient rats.
19801831|a|Effects of yokukansan (TJ-54) on memory disturbance and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were investigated in thiamine-deficient (TD) rats which were produced by feeding a TD diet for 37 d. Daily oral administration of TJ-54 (0.5, 1.0 g/kg) ameliorated the memory disturbance, anxiety-like behavior, the increase in aggressive behaviors, the decrease in social behaviors, and several neurological symptoms including opisthotonus observed in TD rats, in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, histopathological examinations showed that TJ-54 inhibited the degeneration of neuronal and astroglial cells in the brain stem, hippocampus and cortex in TD rats. Microdialysis experiments showed that TJ-54 inhibited extracellular glutamate rise in the ventral posterior medial thalamus in TD rats. These results suggest that TJ-54 possesses the preventive or progress inhibitive effect against the development of memory disturbance and BPSD-like behaviors induced by the degeneration of neuronal and astroglial cells resulting from TD. TJ-54 may inhibit glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity as one of mechanisms.

20337951|t|Electron-microscopic examination of effects of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on degeneration of cerebral cells in thiamine-deficient rats.
20337951|a|UNASSIGNED: We previously demonstrated that yokukansan ameliorated not only learning disturbance but also behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia-like behaviors (anxiety, aggressiveness) and neurological symptoms (opisthotonus) induced in rats by dietary thiamine deficiency (TD). In the present study, the effects of yokukansan on degeneration of cerebral cells were further examined electron-microscopically during pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages in TD rats. In the pre-symptomatic TD stage, which appeared as increase in aggressive behaviors on the 21st and 28th days of TD diet-feeding, severe edematous degeneration of astrocytes was detected by electron microscopy, although the changes were not observed by light microscopy. In the symptomatic TD stage (the 34th day) characterized by development of neurological symptoms, severe sponge-like degeneration and multiple hemorrhages in the parenchyma were obvious by light microscopy. The electron-microscopic examination showed degeneration in neurons, oligodendroglias, and myelin sheaths in addition to astrocytes. TD rats, which exhibited multiple hemorrhages light microscopically, showed severe edematous changes and hypertrophy of the foot processes of astrocytes surrounding blood vessels. Administration of yokukansan ameliorated not only the TD-induced aggressive behavior and neurological symptoms but also degeneration of the cerebral cells. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of yokukansan on degeneration in various brain cells might be closely related to the amelioration of aggression and neurological symptoms in TD rats.

25954314|t|Efficacy and safety of yokukansan in treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
25954314|a|Objectives. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of TJ-54 (Yokukansan) in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Methods. One hundred and twenty antipsychotic-treated inpatients were included. Patients were randomized to adjuvant treatment with TJ-54 or placebo. During a 4-week follow-up, psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results. TJ-54 showed a tendency of being superior to placebo in reduction total, positive, and general PANSS scores in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but the difference was not statistically significant in both per-protocol set (PPS) and intention-to-treat (ITT). However, in PPS analysis, compared to the placebo group, the TJ-54 group showed statistically significant improvements in the individual PANSS subscale scores for lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation (TJ-54: -0.23    0.08; placebo: -0.03    0.08, P < 0.018), tension (TJ-54: -0.42    0.09; placebo: -0.18    0.09, P < 0.045), and poor impulse control (TJ-54: -0.39    0.10; placebo: -0.07    0.10, P < 0.037). Conclusions. The results of the present study indicate that TJ-54 showed a tendency of being superior to placebo in reduction PANSS scores in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, compared to the placebo group, TJ-54 group showed statistically significant improvements in the individual PANSS subscale scores.

24923986|t|Efficacy and safety of yokukansan in treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, five-factor analysis).
24923986|a|BACKGROUND: Treating schizophrenia patients who fail to respond to antipsychotics is a major challenge, and the percentage of treatment-resistant patients is estimated to be 20-25  %. Recent studies indicate that yokukansan (YKS; D2 and 5HT1A partial agonist and 5HT2A and glutamate antagonist) to be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with dementia and other neuropsychiatric conditions. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of YKS in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. METHODS: This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted between May 2010 and August 2012. One hundred twenty antipsychotic-treated inpatients from 34 psychiatric hospitals in Japan were included. Patients were randomized to adjuvant treatment with YKS 7.5  g/day or placebo. During a 4-week follow-up, psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) with five factors [excitement/hostility (P4, P7, G8, and G14), depression/anxiety (G1, G2, G3, G4, and G6), cognition (P2, N5, N7, G5, G10, G11, G12, G13, and G15], positive (P1, P3, P5, P6, and G9), and negative (N1, N2, N3, N4, N6, G7, and G16]]. Other assessments included, Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). The primary efficacy outcome was the change in PANSS five-factor scores. The secondary outcomes were changes in the scores of CGI-S. The analysis was made on a modified intention to treat basis with the help of a last observation carried forward method. RESULTS: YKS showed a tendency of superiority to placebo in reducing total all PANSS five-factor scores in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but the difference was not statistically significant in total, depression/anxiety, cognition, positive, and negative factors. However, compared to the placebo group, the YKS group showed statistically significant improvements in the PANSS excitement/hostility factor scores (p   <   0.05). No substantial side effects were recorded. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate YKS to be a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, particularly to improve excitement/hostility symptoms.

19729050|t|Influence of aging on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression and neural stem/progenitor cells in rat brain and improving effects of a herbal medicine, yokukansan.
19729050|a|There is evidence of structural and functional deterioration in the brain, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, during the normal aging process in animals and humans. Extracellular matrix-associated glycoproteins, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), are involved in not only maintaining the structures and functions of adult neurons, but also regulating the proliferation, migration, and neurite outgrowth of neural stem cells in the brain. On the other hand, a herbal medicine, yokukansan (YKS), is used in a variety of clinical situations for treating symptoms associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, but its pharmacological properties have not been fully understood. The present study was designed to clarify the influence of aging and the improving effects of YKS on the expression of aggrecan, a major molecule of CSPGs, and on the proliferation and migration of neural stem/progenitor cells identified by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in the PFC and hippocampus including the dentate gyrus. Aged rats (24 months old) showed a significant increase in aggrecan expression throughout the PFC and in the hippocampus particularly in the CA3 subfield, but not the dentate gyrus compared to young rats (5 months old), evaluated by the immunohistochemical method. YKS treatment decreased the age-related increase in aggrecan expression as well as normal expression in young rats. Aged rats also showed a decreased number of BrdU-labeled cells in the PFC and hippocampus, and these decreases were improved by YKS treatment, which also increased the numbers in young rats. These results suggest that aging influences the microenvironment for adult and immature neurons in the brain, which may affect the proliferation and migration of neural stem/progenitor cells, and YKS has pharmacological potency for these age-related events. These findings help to understand the physiology and pathology of the aged brain and provide an anti-aging strategy for the brain.

25446602|t|Protective effects of glycycoumarin and procyanidin B1, active components of traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan, on amyloid b oligomer-induced neuronal death.
25446602|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, is composed of seven medicinal herbs, and has been traditionally used to treat neurosis, insomnia, and night crying and irritability in children. Yokukansan and its constituent herbs, Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook, have recently been shown to have protective effects against amyloid b (Ab) oligomer-induced apoptosis by suppressing the activation of caspase-3 in primary cultured neurons. The aim of the present study was to identify the effective components of Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook against Ab oligomer-induced neurotoxicity. We also attempted to clarify the mechanisms by which yokukansan and these herbs, as well as their components, suppressed the activation of caspase-3 in Ab oligomer-treated neurons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat primary cultured cortical neurons were treated with Ab oligomer (3 M). The protective effects of 16 components derived from Glycyrrhiza or Uncaria Hook against Ab oligomer-induced neurotoxicity were determined using the MTT reduction assay 48h after the treatment. The suppressive effects of the test substances, i.e., yokukansan, Glycyrrhiza, Uncaria Hook, and screened components, on the Ab oligomer-induced activation of caspase-3(/7) were evaluated using the caspase-Glo assay 48h after the Ab oligomer treatment. The suppressive effects of the test substances on the activation of caspase-8 and -9, both of which are located upstream of caspase-3, were also examined 24h after the Ab oligomer treatment. RESULTS: Two of the 16 components tested, glycycoumarin derived from Glycyrrhiza and procyanidin B1 derived from Uncaria Hook, significantly inhibited Ab oligomer-induced neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner. Glycyrrhiza, Uncaria Hook, and yokukansan significantly suppressed the Ab oligomer-induced activation of caspase-3 as well as caspase-8 and -9. Glycycoumarin also suppressed the activation of caspase-3, but not caspase-8 and -9. Procyanidin B1 suppressed the activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that glycycoumarin and procyanidin B1 had ameliorative effects on Ab oligomer-induced neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effects of glycycoumarin are thought to be due to the attenuated activation of caspase-3, but not caspase-8 or -9. Procyanidin B1, as well as yokukansan, Glycyrrhiza, and Uncaria Hook, may attenuate the activation of caspase-3 by inhibiting that of caspase-8 and -9.

25551766|t|Yokukansan, a kampo medicine, protects PC12 cells from glutamate-induced death by augmenting gene expression of cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc-.
25551766|a|Effects of the kampo medicine yokukansan on gene expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system Xc-, which protects against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity, were examined in Pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells). Yokukansan inhibited glutamate-induced PC12 cell death. Similar cytoprotective effects were found in Uncaria hook. Experiments to clarify the active compounds revealed that geissoschizine methyl ether, hirsuteine, hirsutine, and procyanidin B1 in Uncaria hook, had cytoprotective effects. These components enhanced gene expressions of system Xc- subunits xCT and 4F2hc, and also ameliorated the glutamate-induced decrease in glutathione levels. These results suggest that the cytoprotective effect of yokukansan may be attributed to geissoschizine methyl ether, hirsuteine, hirsutine, and procyanidin B1 in Uncaria hook.

19818347|t|Glycyrrhizin and its metabolite 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid in glycyrrhiza, a constituent herb of yokukansan, ameliorate thiamine deficiency-induced dysfunction of glutamate transport in cultured rat cortical astrocytes.
19818347|a|Effects of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, on thiamine deficiency (TD)-induced decrease of glutamate uptake were examined in cultured rat cortical astrocytes. Yokukansan (100-500 microg/ml) ameliorated the TD-induced decrease in glutamate uptake by astrocytes, implying that yokukansan may contain active herbs and compounds possessing this effect. Among the seven constituent herbs of yokukansan, significant effects were found for glycyrrhiza. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin and its metabolite 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (10(-7)-10(-4)M), among the eight components of glycyrrhiza, ameliorated the TD-induced decrease of glutamate uptake in astrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. These substances inhibited protein kinase C (PKC) activity under the in vitro conditions. These lines of evidence suggest that glycyrrhizin, a main component of glycyrrhiza, and its metabolite 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid are likely responsible for amelioration of dysfunction of glutamate transport in astrocytes. The inhibition of the PKC activity might be related to the pharmacological efficacy of these substances.

21130853|t|Yokukansan, a kampo medicine, protects against glutamate cytotoxicity due to oxidative stress in PC12 cells.
21130853|a|AIM OF THE STUDY: Yokukansan is a traditional Japanese medicine consisted of seven medicinal herbs and has been used for treatment of neurosis, insomnia, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in Japan. The aim of the present study is to clarify the active compounds responsible for the protective effect of yokukansan against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC12 cells which is a tool for selective evaluation of test substances against oxidative stress was used in the present study. The cell survival rates or glutathione (GSH) levels were evaluated by a MTT reduction assay or GSH assay based on the GSH reductase enzymatic recycling method, respectively. RESULTS: Glutamate (1-17.5mM) induced cell death of PC12 cells in a concentration- dependent manner. Yokukansan (125-500 g/ml) inhibited the glutamate-induced PC12 cell death. When the effects of extracts of the seven constituent herbs in yokukansan on the cell death were examined, Uncaria thorn was found to have the highest potency in the protection. To clarify the active compounds in Uncaria thorn, the effects of seven alkaloids (rhynchophylline, isorhynchophylline, corynoxeine, isocorynoxeine, hirsutine, hirsuteine, and geissoschizine methyl ether) on the cell death were further examined. The protective effects were found in hirsutine, hirsuteine, and geissoschizine methyl ether, which also ameliorated the glutamate-induced decrease in GSH levels. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that yokukansan protects against PC12 cell death induced by glutamate-mediated oxidative stress, i.e., reduction of intracellular GSH level, and the effect may be mainly attributed to a synergistic effect of the hirsutine, hirsuteine, and geissoschizine methyl ether in Uncaria thorn.

27042075|t|Yokukansan improves behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia by suppressing dopaminergic function.
27042075|a|Although three drugs, risperidone, yokukansan, and fluvoxamine, have shown equal efficacy in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in our previous study, their mechanisms of action are different from one another. Monoamines have attracted attention for their key roles in mediating several behavioral symptoms or psychological symptoms through synaptic signaling. We aimed to clarify the monoamines changed by treatment with each drug in patients with BPSD. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma levels of catecholamine metabolites are correlated with pharmacological treatments. This was an 8-week, rater-blinded, randomized, flexible-dose, triple-group trial. In total, 90 subjects were recruited and subsequently three different drugs were allocated to 82 inpatients with BPSD. We examined BPSD data from patients who completed 8 weeks of treatment. Eventually, we analyzed 42 patients (yokukansan: 17; risperidone: 9; fluvoxamine: 16). Homovanillic acid, a metabolite of dopamine, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, a metabolite of noradrenaline, in their plasma were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. All three drugs showed equal significant efficacy between baseline and study endpoint. By contrast, biomarkers showed mutually different changes. Patients in the yokukansan group had significantly decreased plasma homovanillic acid levels from baseline. Conversely, patients in the risperidone and fluvoxamine groups exhibited no significant changes in plasma homovanillic acid levels from baseline. Yokukansan contains geissoschizine methyl ether, which is known to have a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2 receptors. An improvement in BPSD condition with the intake of yokukansan is suggested to occur through a suppressed dopaminergic function, which is similar to the effect of aripiprazole.

25210456|t|Yokukansan and its ingredients as possible treatment options for schizophrenia.
25210456|a|Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychotic mental disorder that affects almost the entire range of human mental function. The devastating effect of the illness is usually long-lasting and requires lifelong treatment. Despite an evolved psychopharmacological understanding, the overall therapeutic effect of antipsychotics is still not satisfactory. The choice of proper medication presents a clinical dilemma between efficacy and safety. As a result, searching for comparable treatment options with safer profiles is very important. Yokukansan (TJ-54), also called yi-gan san in Chinese, is a traditional herbal medicine with evident therapeutic effect for neuropsychiatric disorders. There are several open-label clinical studies upholding the possibility of using yokukansan to treat schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. Evidence from animal studies and neurobiology also sheds light on the antipsychotic implications of yokukansan and its ingredients. Nevertheless, correlations between the experimental environment and clinical settings may be complicated by a number of confounders. Clinical trials with more sophisticated designs are required to fill the gap between the experimental environment and clinical settings.

23567442|t|Yokukansan treatment of chronic renal failure patients receiving hemodialysis, with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: an open-label study.
23567442|a|OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of yokukansan (YKS) for chronic renal failure (CRF) patients receiving hemodialysis with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) was evaluated. METHODS: Twelve CRF patients receiving hemodialysis with BPSD were recruited and 7.5 g of YKS powder was added to ongoing therapy with antipsychotics. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) criteria and Barthel Index before and after 4-week YKS treatment were compared. RESULTS: Analysis of the mean score for NPI revealed a significant improvement during the period of YKS administration (25.3    17.6 versus 8.36    4.46; p  = 0.0069). The mean score for the Barthel Index showed no significant difference during the period of YKS administration. Mean level of serum potassium was still within the normal range. No subjects had severe adverse reactions necessitating discontinuation from the study. CONCLUSION: Yokukansan significantly improved the symptoms of BPSD in CRF patients receiving hemodialysis without critical side effects.

24129119|t|Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, alleviates the emotional abnormality induced by maladaptation to stress in mice.
24129119|a|The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine that is composed of Atractylodis lanceae Rhizoma, Poria, Cnidii Rhizoma, Uncariae Uncis cum Ramulus, Angelicae Radix, Bupleuri Radix and Glycyrrhizae Radix, on the emotional abnormality induced by maladaptation to stress in mice. Mice were exposed to repeated restraint stress for 60 or 240 min/day for 14 days. From the 3rd day of stress exposure, mice were given yokukansan orally (p.o.) or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately after the daily exposure to restraint stress. After the final exposure to restraint stress, the emotionality of mice was evaluated using an automatic hole-board apparatus. A single exposure to restraint stress for 60 min induced a decrease in head-dipping behavior in the hole-board test. This emotional stress response disappeared in mice that had been exposed to repeated restraint stress for 60 min/day for 14 days, which confirmed the development of stress adaptation. In contrast, mice that were exposed to restraint stress for 240 min/day for 14 days did not develop this stress adaptation, and still showed a decrease in head-dipping behavior. The decreased emotionality observed in stress-maladaptive mice was significantly recovered by chronic treatment with yokukansan (1000 mg/kg, p.o.) as well as flesinoxan (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after daily exposure to stress. These findings suggest that yokukansan may have a beneficial effect on stress adaptation and alleviate the emotional abnormality under conditions of excessive stress.

21303686|t|Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, ameliorates memory disturbance and abnormal social interaction with anti-aggregation effect of cerebral amyloid b proteins in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.
21303686|a|The deposition of amyloid b protein (Ab) is a consistent pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Therefore, inhibition of Ab aggregation in the brain is an attractive therapeutic and preventive strategy in the development of disease-modifying drugs for AD. An in vitro study demonstrated that yokukansan (YKS), a traditional Japanese medicine, inhibited Ab aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. An in vivo study demonstrated that YKS and Uncaria hook (UH), a constituent of YKS, prevented the accumulation of cerebral Ab. YKS also improved the memory disturbance and abnormal social interaction such as increased aggressive behavior and decreased social behavior in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. These results suggest that YKS is likely to be a potent and novel therapeutic agent to prevent and/or treat AD, and that this may be attributed to UH.

24190599|t|Geissoschizine methyl ether, an alkaloid from the Uncaria hook, improves remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination in medial prefrontal cortex of adult mice.
24190599|a|Accumulating evidence indicates that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a site of myelin and oligodendrocyte abnormalities that contribute to psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. The development of therapeutic approaches to enhance remyelination, a regenerative process in which new myelin sheaths are formed on demyelinated axons, may be an attractive remedial strategy. Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) in the Uncaria hook, a galenical constituent of the traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan (Yi-gan san), is one of the active components responsible for the psychotropic effects of yokukansan, though little is known about the mechanisms underlying the effects of either that medicine or GM itself. In the present study, we employed a cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination model and examined the cellular changes in response to GM administration during the remyelination phase in the mPFC of adult mice. Using the mitotic marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), we demonstrated that CPZ treatment significantly increased the number of BrdU-positive NG2 cells, as well as microglia and mature oligodendrocytes in the mPFC. Newly formed oligodendrocytes were increased by GM administration after CPZ exposure. In addition, GM attenuated a decrease in myelin basic protein immunoreactivity caused by CPZ administration. Taken together, our findings suggest that GM administration ameliorated the myelin deficit by mature oligodendrocyte formation and remyelination in the mPFC of CPZ-fed mice. The present findings provide experimental evidence supporting the role for GM and its possible use as a remedy for schizophrenia symptoms by promoting the differentiation of progenitor cells to and myelination by oligodendrocytes.

25456433|t|Specific binding and characteristics of geissoschizine methyl ether, an indole alkaloid of Uncaria Hook, in the rat brain.
25456433|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) is an indole alkaloid that is a component of Uncaria Hook, and has been identified as the active component responsible for the anti-aggressive effects of the Uncaria Hook-containing traditional Japanese medicine, yokukansan. Recently, GM was shown to reach the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier in rats following the oral administration of yokukansan. This finding suggested that there may be specific binding sites for GM in the brain. Here we show evidence that tritium-labeled GM ([(3)H]GM) binds specifically to several brain areas of rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats were used. [(3)H]GM was synthesized from a demethylated derivative of GM. Specific binding sites of [(3)H]GM on brain sections were determined by quantitative autoradiography, and maximum binding densities (Bmax) and dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated. Several chemical compounds were used to clarify the molecules that recognize [(3)H]GM in the completion-binding assay. Emulsion microautoradiography was also performed to identify the cells that bind [(3)H]GM. RESULTS: Specific binding of [(3)H]GM was observed in the frontal cortex, including the prefrontal cortical region (e.g., prelimbic cortex (PrL)), hippocampus, caudate putamen, amygdala, central medial thalamic nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), and cerebellum. Bmax ranged between 0.65 and 8.79pmol/mg tissue, and Kd was between 35.0 and 232.6nM. Specific binding with relatively high affinity (Kd less than 62nM) was dense in the frontal cortical region, moderate in the DR, and sparse in the cerebellum. The specific binding of [(3)H]GM in the PrL was significantly replaced by the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (DPAT), 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin, 5-HT2B receptor agonist BW 723C86, 5-HT2C receptor agonist RO60-0175, adrenergic a2A receptor antagonist yohimbine, L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil, and  -opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Similar results were obtained in the frontal cortex and DR, but not in the cerebellum. Microautoradiography revealed that [(3)H]GM signals were distributed throughout the frontal cortex, which included neuron-like large cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that specific binding sites for GM exist in rat brain tissue, and suggest that the pharmacological actions of GM are mainly associated with 5-HT receptors in the frontal cortex and DR. These results provide an insight into the neuropharmacology of GM and GM-containing herbal medicines.

23966085|t|Antianxiety-like effects of Chimpi (dried citrus peels) in the elevated open-platform test.
23966085|a|Dried citrus peels (Chimpi) is one of the most common natural medicines with qi (energy flow) rectifying and shi (dampness) drying actions, which originates from Citrus unshiu, and/or C. reticulata according to the definition of the pharmacopoeiae of Japan and China. In this study, the pharmacological effects of their extracts and major chemical constituents hesperidin and its aglycone hesperetin on anxiety were examined with an anxiety model of elevated open-platform test using ICR male mice (6-week-old) and total duration of freezing was decreased in fluoxetine-treated mice, which is a simple and highly sensitive to the effects of serotonergic anxiolytics. Moreover, yokukansankachimpihange (YKH), a combination of yokukansan with Chimpi and Hange (Pinellia) was also examined because Chimpi is considered to play a crucial part in this formula against anxious symptoms in dementia patients. The results showed that Chimpi and YKH possess a significant anxiolytic-like effect similar to that of fluoxetine, suggesting that they might be similar to fluoxetine in their pharmacological actions through the serotonergic neurotransmission pathway. Moreover, it also suggested that the major chemical constituent, hesperidin could be an active principle attributed to the antianxiety-like effects with a direct and indirect role via its aglycone hesperetin.

24752617|t|Specific binding and characteristics of 18b-glycyrrhetinic acid in rat brain.
24752617|a|18b-Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is the aglycone of glycyrrhizin that is a component of Glycyrrhiza, and has several pharmacological actions in the central nervous system. Recently, GA has been demonstrated to reach the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier in rats after oral administration of a Glycyrrhiza-containing traditional Japanese medicine, yokukansan. These findings suggest that there are specific binding sites for GA in the brain. Here we show evidence that [3H]GA binds specifically to several brain areas by quantitative autoradiography; the density was higher in the hippocampus, moderate in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and mid brain, and lower in the brain stem and cerebellum. Several kinds of steroids, gap junction-blocking reagents, glutamate transporter-recognized compounds, and glutamate receptor agonists did not inhibit the [3H]GA binding. Microautoradiography showed that the [3H]GA signals in the hippocampus were distributed in small non-neuronal cells similar to astrocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that immunoreactivity of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 (11b-HSD1), a defined molecule recognized by GA, was detected mainly in neurons, moderately in astrocytes, and very slightly in microglial cells, of the hippocampus. These results demonstrate that specific binding sites for GA exist in rat brain tissue, and suggest that the pharmacological actions of GA may be related to 11b-HSD1 in astrocytes. This finding provides important information to understand the pharmacology of GA in the brain.

24305622|t|Yokukansan promotes hippocampal neurogenesis associated with the suppression of activated microglia in Gunn rat.
24305622|a|BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ) remains unclear, and its treatment is far from ideal. We have previously reported that yokukansan (YKS), which is a traditional Japanese medicine, is effective as an adjunctive therapy for SCZ. However, the mechanisms underlying the action of YKS have not yet been completely elucidated. A recent meta-analysis study has shown that adjuvant anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for SCZ treatment, and it has been proposed that some of the cognitive deficits associated with inflammation may in part be related to inflammation-induced reductions in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Although certain ingredients of YKS have potent anti-inflammatory activity, no study has determined if YKS has anti-inflammatory properties. METHODS: Using the Gunn rat, which has been reported as a possible animal model of SCZ, we investigated whether YKS affects cognitive dysfunction in an object-location test and the suppression of microglial activation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. RESULTS: We found that YKS ameliorated spatial working memory in the Gunn rats. Furthermore, YKS inhibited microglial activation and promoted neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of these rats. These results suggest that the ameliorative effects of YKS on cognitive deficits may be mediated in part by the suppression of the inflammatory activation of microglia. CONCLUSIONS: These findings shed light on the possible mechanism underlying the efficacy of YKS in treating SCZ.

20675883|t|[Development of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease].
20675883|a|Currently, only donepezil is available for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) in Japan. Clinical trials of galantamine, rivastigmine, and memantine have been completed in Japan, and patients are awaiting government approval for the use of these drugs. The herbal medicine yokukansan was found to be effective for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients, and juzentaihoto was found to reduce AD pathology in a mouse model. In addition, muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, serotonergic agonists, other drugs are being developed. These medicines have little effect on the improvement of cognitive functions. The anti-histamine dimebolin was expected to have a significant effect on the improvement of cognitive functions, but unfortunately, it was rejected during phase III clinical trials. Disease modifying drugs such as alpha-secretase activators, beta- and gamma-secretase inhibitors or modulators, inhibitors of Abeta and tau aggregation, enhancers of Abeta degradation, immunotherapies to remove Abeta oligomers and fibrils, and neurotrophic factors are being developed. Some of these drugs are in phase III clinical trials and are expected to be available for clinical use in the near future.

25633336|t|Metabolic profiling of the uncaria hook alkaloid geissoschizine methyl ether in rat and human liver microsomes using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.
25633336|a|Geissoschizine methyl ether (GM) is an indole alkaloid found in Uncaria hook, which is a galenical constituent of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine. GM has been identified as the active component responsible for anti-aggressive effects. In this study, the metabolic profiling of GM in rat and human liver microsomes was investigated. Thirteen metabolites of GM were elucidated and identified using a high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method, and their molecular structures were proposed on the basis of the characteristics of their precursor ions, product ions, and chromatographic retention times. There were no differences in the metabolites between the rat and human liver microsomes. Among the 13 identified metabolites, there were two demethylation metabolites, one dehydrogenation metabolite, three methylation metabolites, three oxidation metabolites, two water-adduct metabolites, one di-demethylation metabolite, and one water-adduct metabolite followed by oxidation. The metabolic pathways of GM were proposed on the basis of this study. This study will be helpful in understanding the metabolic routes of GM and related Uncaria hook alkaloids, and provide useful information on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This is the first report that describes the separation and identification of GM metabolites in rat and human liver microsomes.

23378767|t|Orengedoku-to augmentation in cases showing partial response to yokukan-san treatment: a case report and literature review of the evidence for use of these Kampo herbal formulae.
23378767|a|BACKGROUND: Yokukan-san, a Japanese traditional herbal (Kampo) prescription, has recently gathered increasing attention due to accumulating reports showing its remarkable efficacy in treating a wide variety of diseases refractory to conventional medicine as well as the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. As yokukan-san has become broadly integrated with conventional medicine, augmentation therapy with other Kampo prescriptions has become necessary when the yokukan-san has been only partially efficacious. In this paper, we report three cases in which the addition of orengedoku-to, another Kampo formula, to yokukan-san was remarkably effective. CASES: Case 1 was an 85-year-old man with Alzheimer-type dementia who had become aggressive during the past 2 years. Three milligrams of aripiprazole completely suppressed his problematic behaviors but had to be stopped because of extrapyramidal symptoms. In the second case, a 44-year-old man with methamphetamine-induced psychosis had suffered from serious tardive dystonia for 2 years. No conventional approach had improved his tardive dystonia. The third case was a 29-year-old engineer who often failed to resist aggressive impulses and was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder. He was prescribed 5 mg of olanzapine, which did not suppress his extraordinary anger and caused somnolence even though the dose was low. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Yokukan-san was complementarily added to the patients' regular medication and exerted a definitive but partial effect in all cases. The addition of orengedoku-to to yokukan-san exerted the same efficacy as aripiprazole in controlling aggressiveness in Case 1, improved the tardive dystonia by 80% in Case 2, and was completely effective in controlling the patient's aggressive impulses in Case 3. CONCLUSION: Together with empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of both yokukansan and orengedoku-to in reducing irritability, impulsivity, and aggression, these three cases suggest that orengedoku-to augmentation can be an effective option in cases that are partially responsive to yokukan-san treatment.

23453830|a|BACKGROUND: Although schizophrenia affects all age groups, late or very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis has not been well studied, and various treatment issues remain unresolved. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of yokukansan (TJ-54), Japanese herbal medicine, monotherapy in a diagnostically homogenous group of elderly patients without cognitive impairment suffering from very-late-onset schizophrenia. METHODS: Forty patients of mean age 73.1  4.8 years, fulfilling both the recent consensus criteria for very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis and the DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia, were assessed by the brief psychiatric rating scale, the clinical global impression scale-severity, and positive and negative syndrome scale at baseline and after 4 weeks administration of TJ-54 (2.5-7.5 g/day). In addition, abnormal movements were evaluated with the Simpson-Angus scale, Barnes Akathisia scale, and abnormal involuntary movement scale. RESULTS: A highly significant (p<0.001) improvement on all measures of psychotic symptomatology was observed in all patients. TJ-54 was very well tolerated by the patients, and no clinically significant adverse effects were observed. Scores on all abnormal movement scales did not differ significantly prior to and after TJ-54 treatment. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results indicate that TJ-54 appears to be an efficacious and safe herbal medicine for treatment of very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.

26725433|t|Yokukansan, a Traditional Japanese Medicine, Enhances the L-DOPA-Induced Rotational Response in 6-Hydroxydopamine-Lesioned Rats: Possible Inhibition of COMT.
26725433|a|The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan (YKS) on the function of dopamine (DA) in the rat nigrostriatal system. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were produced in the rat nigrostriatal system. Despite a marked loss in the striatal immunoreactivity of tyrosine hydroxylase on the lesion side, striatal serotonin (5-HT) immunoreactivity was not affected. Treatment using L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in conjunction with benserazide for 15   d induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) such as locomotive (rotational response), axial, forelimb, and orolingual movements in the lesioned rats. The L-DOPA-induced locomotive and axial, but not forelimb and orolingual, AIMs were significantly increased and prolonged by the pre-administration of YKS. We next investigated the effects of YKS on the production of DA from L-DOPA in 5-HT synthetic RIN 14B cells. RIN 14B cells produced DA and its metabolite, 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), following L-DOPA treatment. YKS significantly augmented DA production and inhibited its metabolism to 3-MT in a manner similar to the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone. YKS and some alkaloids (corynoxeine: CX, geissoschizine methyl ether: GM) in Uncaria hook, a constituent herb of YKS, also inhibited COMT activity, indicating that the augmenting effect of YKS on L-DOPA-induced DA production in 5-HT synthetic cells was due to the inhibition of COMT by CX and GM. Our results suggest that YKS facilitates the DA supplemental effect of L-DOPA, and that COMT inhibition by CX and GM contributes, at least in part, to the effects of YKS.

25857947|t|Yokukansan normalizes glucocorticoid receptor protein expression in oligodendrocytes of the corpus callosum by regulating microRNA-124a expression after stress exposure.
25857947|a|UNASSIGNED: Stressful events are known to down-regulate expression levels of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the brain. Recently, we reported that stressed mice with elevated plasma levels of corticosterone exhibit morphological changes in the oligodendrocytes of nerve fiber bundles, such as those in the corpus callosum. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of GR expression regulation in oligodendrocytes after stress exposure. A previous report has suggested that GR protein levels might be regulated by microRNA (miR)-18 and/or -124a in the brain. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the GR regulation mechanism in oligodendrocytes and evaluate the effects of yokukansan (YKS), a Kampo medicine, on GR protein regulation. Acute exposure to stress increased plasma corticosterone levels, decreased GR protein expression, and increased miR-124a expression in the corpus callosum of adult male mice, though the GR mRNA and miR-18 expression levels were not significant changes. YKS normalized the stress-induced changes in the plasma corticosterone, GR protein, and miR124a expression levels. An oligodendrocyte primary culture study also showed that YKS down-regulated miR-124a, but not miR-18, expression levels in dexamethasone-treated cells. These results suggest that the down-regulation of miR124a expression might be involved in the normalization of stress-induced decreases in GR protein in oligodendrocytes by YKS. This effect may imply the molecular mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effects of YKS on psychological symptoms and stress-related behaviors.

26085043|t|Pharmacological Management of Lewy Body Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
26085043|a|OBJECTIVE: The authors examined research on effects, costs, and patient and caregiver views of pharmacological management strategies for Lewy body dementia. METHOD: Studies were identified through bibliographic databases, trials registers, gray literature, reference lists, and experts. The authors used the search terms "Lewy or parkinson" and "dementia" through March 2015 and used the following inclusion criteria: participants with diagnoses of Lewy body dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson's disease dementia (or participants' caregivers); investigation of pharmacological management strategies; outcome measures and test scores reported. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by at least two authors. Meta-analyses were conducted, and when studies could not be combined, summaries were provided. RESULTS: Forty-four studies examining 22 strategies were included in the review. Meta-analysis indicated beneficial effects of donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Rivastigmine, but not donepezil, was associated with greater risk of adverse events. Meta-analysis of memantine suggested that it is well tolerated but with few benefits. Descriptive summaries provide some evidence of benefits for galantamine, modafinil, levodopa, rotigotine, clozapine, duloxetine, clonazepam, ramelteon, gabapentin, zonisamide, and yokukansan. Piracetam, amantadine, selegiline, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and citalopram do not appear to be effective. CONCLUSIONS: High-level evidence related to pharmacological strategies for managing Lewy body dementia is rare. Strategies for important areas of need in Lewy body dementia, such as autonomic symptoms and caregiver burden, have not been investigated, nor have the views of patients and caregivers about pharmacological strategies.

23194148|t|Yokukansan (TJ-54) for treatment of pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and Asperger's disorder: a 12-week prospective, open-label study.
23194148|a|BACKGROUND: Numerous medications have been tested on patients with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger's disorder. Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear primary treatment for PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, the acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Japanese herbal medicine yokukansan (TJ-54) may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia and some neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of TJ-54 in patients with well-defined PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder. METHODS: This was a 12-week prospective, open-label investigation of TJ-54 in 40 children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. Primary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Iritability subscale score (ABC-I). RESULTS: Forty subjects, ages 8-40 years (mean 22.7    7.3 years) received a mean final TJ-54 dosage of 6.4    1.3 g/day (range 2.5-7.5 g/day). Full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) scores ranged from 70 to 110 (mean 88.9    13.2). Thirty-six (90%) of 40 subjects showed fewer interfering symptoms of irritability, including aggression, self-injury, and tantrums, with a final CGI-S of 1 or 2 (normal, not at all ill or borderline mentally ill) and a 80% or greater improvement on the ABC-I. The mean CGI-S score at baseline was 6.8    0.8 whereas scores at end point was 1.9    0.1 (< 0.0001). ABC-I scores ranged from 11 to 29 (mean 17.4    3.66) at baseline, whereas scores at week 12 ranged from 0 to 5 (mean 0.93    0.97) (p <0.0001). TJ-54 was well tolerated. No subject exited the study due to a drug-related adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that TJ-54 may be effective and well tolerated for treatment of severe irritability, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech in patients with PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. However, given the characteristics of this trial, the present findings should be taken cautiously, and larger-scale placebo-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy and tolerability of TJ-54 in this understudied population.

21639405|t|The role of phytochemicals in the treatment and prevention of dementia.
21639405|a|Dementia pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reaching epidemic proportions, yet they are not successfully managed by effective symptomatic treatments. Only five drugs have been developed to alleviate cognitive symptoms, and more effective and safe treatments are needed for both the cognitive symptoms and behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). As two of these licensed drugs (cholinesterase inhibitors [ChEIs]) are naturally derived (galantamine and rivastigmine), the potential for plants to yield new therapeutic agents has stimulated extensive research to discover new ChEIs together with plant extracts, phytochemicals and their derivatives with other mechanistic effects relevant to dementia treatment. This review presents the potential and actual therapeutic strategies for dementia in relation to the known mechanisms of dementia pathology. Phytochemicals that have shown mechanistic effects relevant to the pathological targets in dementia are discussed, with an emphasis on those showing positive clinical trial evidence. Those phytochemicals discussed include the alkaloid physostigmine, a ChEI from the calabar bean (Physostigma venenosum), which has been used as a template for the development of synthetic derivatives that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, including the drug rivastigmine. Also discussed are other ChEI alkaloids including huperzine A, from Huperzia serrata, and galantamine, originally from the snowdrop (Galanthus woronowii); both alkaloids improve cognitive functions in AD patients. Other phytochemicals discussed include cannabinoids (e.g. cannabidiol) from Cannabis sativa, which are emerging as potential therapeutic agents for BPSD, and resveratrol (occurs in various plants) and curcumin (from turmeric [Curcuma longa]), which have been investigated for their pharmacological activities relevant to dementia and their potential effects on delaying dementia progression. The review also discusses plant extracts, and their known constituents, that have shown relevant mechanistic effects for dementia and promising clinical data, but require more evidence for their clinical efficacy and safety. Such plants include Ginkgo biloba, which has been extensively studied in numerous clinical trials, with most outcomes showing positive effects on cognitive functions in dementia patients; however, more reliable and consistent clinical data are needed to confirm efficacy. Other plants and their extracts that have produced promising clinical data in dementia patients, with respect to cognition, include saffron (Crocus sativus), ginseng (Panax species), sage (Salvia species) and lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), although more extensive and reliable clinical data are required. Other plants that are used in traditional practices of medicine have been suggested to improve cognitive functions (e.g. Polygala tenuifolia) or have been associated with alleviation of BPSD (e.g. the traditional prescription yokukansan); such remedies are often prescribed as complex mixtures of different plants, which complicates interpretation of pharmacological and clinical data and introduces additional challenges for quality control. Evidence for the role of natural products in disease prevention, the primary but considerably challenging aim with respect to dementia, is limited, but the available epidemiological and clinical evidence is discussed, with most studies focused on ChEIs, nicotine (from Nicotiana species), curcumin, wine polyphenols such as resveratrol and G. biloba. Challenges for the development of phytochemicals as drugs and for quality control of standardized plant extracts are also considered.

26932472|t|Gut microbiota-involved mechanisms in enhancing systemic exposure of ginsenosides by coexisting polysaccharides in ginseng decoction.
26932472|a|Oral decoctions of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) serve for therapeutic and prophylactic management of diseases for centuries. Small molecules and polysaccharides are the dominant chemicals co-occurred in the TCM decoction. Small molecules are well-studied by multidisciplinary elaborations, whereas the role of polysaccharides remains largely elusive. Here we explore a gut microbiota-involved mechanism by which TCM polysaccharides restore the homeostasis of gut microbiota and consequently promote the systemic exposure of concomitant small molecules in the decoction. As a case study, ginseng polysaccharides and ginsenosides in Du-Shen-Tang, the decoction of ginseng, were investigated on an over-fatigue and acute cold stress model. The results indicated that ginseng polysaccharides improved intestinal metabolism and absorption of certain ginsenosides, meanwhile reinstated the perturbed holistic gut microbiota, and particularly enhanced the growth of Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides spp., two major metabolic bacteria of ginsenosides. By exploring the synergistic actions of polysaccharides with small molecules, these findings shed new light on scientization and rationalization of the classic TCM decoctions in human health care.

23019892|t|[Study on quality evaluation of Panax ginseng based on effects for replenishing qi and preventing exhaustion].
23019892|a|Based on the effect for replenishing Qi and preventing exhaustion, this essay provides a method to rebuild the quality evaluation system of Panax ginseng. As an independent medical system, the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) science lacks enough credible evidences to support its theory and thereby wants more relevant studies. Current, it is a misunderstanding for experimental studies on TCM to prove TCM drugs from the angle of western medicine. Therefore, following study modes are recommended to researchers focusing on either the theory of the unique importance of class origin or the theory of the unique importance of techniques. Under the guidance of TCM theories, a new TCM assessment mode, consisting of clinical efficacy, pharmacological effect and effective components, is established in line with clinical application of TCMs. Studies on Chemical fingerprint or active ingredient are made on effective components. In-depth studies are worth to the viewpoint to rebuild the TCM quality reassessment system. On the basis of analysis on ancient herbal literatures and experience in clinical application of TCMs, the author proves the irreplaceable effect of P. ginseng. (pure ginseng decoction) is to replenish Qi and prevent exhaustion. Based on the major effect, a pharmacological model is established in combination with modern clinical efficacy to screen effective components of ginseng herbs and make a quality assessment on safety and efficiency of clinical application of P. ginseng, in order to provide theoretical and experimental basis for cultivation, development and utilization of P. ginseng resources on Changbai mountain.

26495014|t|"Ninjinto" (Ginseng Decoction), a Traditional Japanese Herbal Medicine, Improves Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Immune Competence in Patients with Chronic Intestinal Failure.
26495014|a|Background. Treating functional gastrointestinal disorders is extremely difficult. We herein report the effect of the oral administration of Ninjinto (NJT, ginseng decoction), a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine, on chronic intestinal failure. Patients and Methods. Seven patients with chronic intestinal failure treated with NJT were evaluated in this study. The primary diseases included chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIPO: n = 4), short bowel syndrome (SBS: n = 2), and intestinal atresia (n = 1). All patients orally received NJT extract granules at a dose of 0.3   g/kg BW per day. The treatment outcomes were then assessed according to the patients' symptoms and consecutive abdominal X-ray findings. Results. The targeted symptoms were abdominal distension in four patients, diarrhea in three patients, and frequent hospitalization due to infections in two patients. An improvement in the symptoms was observed in six of the seven patients, whereas one patient with SBS did not show any improvement. An improvement in an abdominal roentgenogram was observed in the four patients with remarkably dilated bowel loops due to CIPO. Conclusions. NJT may be effective in controlling functional gastrointestinal disorders associated with chronic intestinal failure. The use of Kampo medicine in the field of pediatric surgery may help to improve the quality of life in children suffering from such conditions.

10217316|t|Possible influences of ginseng on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin in rats.
10217316|a|We evaluated the significance of a reported clinical case of drug-drug interaction between ginseng and warfarin using a robust pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach in a rat model. The influence of ginseng on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral warfarin after a single dose (2 mg kg(-1)) and at steady state (0.2 mg kg(-1) daily x 6 days) was studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Prothrombin time was employed as a pharmacodynamic index. Warfarin plasma concentration and vitamin K content in the ginseng extract were assessed by validated HPLC assays. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin after a single dose were not altered in the presence of ginseng; peak plasma concentration (control 7.8+/-0.5; ginseng 7.3+/-2.5 microg mL(-1)), time to peak (control 2.6+/-1.0; ginseng 3.1+/-1.1 h), elimination half-life (control 14.3+/-5.8; ginseng 10.6+/-3.1 h), and oral clearance (control 17.5+/-3.3; ginseng 20.2+/-5.5 mL h(-1)) were not significantly different (P>0.05). Similarly, alterations in the pharmacokinetics of warfarin were not detected under the multiple dosing paradigm. Under both dosing conditions, ginseng also showed no significant impact on the pharmacodynamics of warfarin as assessed by the area under the prothrombin time vs time curve (multiple dosing; control 3776+/-619, ginseng 3830+/-362 sh) and maximum prothrombin time (control 57.2+/-11.8, ginseng 63.3+/-9.1 s). Furthermore, the content of vitamin K was undetectable in the ginseng decoction. In conclusion, current data obtained in the rat showed no significant impact of ginseng on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of warfarin when they are concomitantly administered.

21241764|a|Yukmijihwang-tang (Liu wei di huang tang, Rokumigan; YMJ) has been used for body enrichment; however, little toxicological evaluation of YMJ has been performed to assure its safety for clinical treatment. To increase the safety information for YMJ, its genotoxicity was evaluated. There was no increase in the number of revertant colonies in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium or one strain of Escherichia coli at any concentration of YMJ studied, regardless of the including when dosed with YMJ metabolized with and S-9 microsomal fraction. YMJ significantly increased structural aberrations in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells at the high concentrations (2500 and 5000  g/ml) in the presence or absence of metabolic activation by the S-9 microsomal fraction. Oral administration of YMJ at doses up to 2000 mg/kg did not increase the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow. These results suggest that YMJ is not genotoxic at the proper dose.

21234385|t|Safety Evaluation of Yukmijihwang-tang: Assessment of Acute and Subchronic Toxicity in Rats.
21234385|a|Yukmijihwang-tang (YMJ; Liu wei di huang tang (China), Rokumigan (Japan)) has been used in the treatment of diseases including renal disorder, cognitive vitality, and diabetes mellitus. However, there is very little information regarding the toxicity of YMJ to give an assurance of safety for clinical treatment. To provide safety information for YMJ, we evaluated its acute and sub-chronic toxicity in rats. The single-dose toxicity of YMJ was examined using Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were treated with YMJ extract orally at 0, 500, 1000, or 2000   mg/kg body weight. After a single administration, clinical signs were observed every day for two weeks, and body weights were measured five times, including an initial measurement on day 1 (the day of administration). In the sub-chronic oral toxicity study, YMJ was administered to rats at 0, 500, 1000, or 2000   mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. Mortalities, clinical signs, body weight changes, food and water consumption, ophthalmologic findings, urinalysis, hematological and biochemical parameters, gross findings, organ weights, and histological examination were monitored during the study period. We found no mortality and no abnormalities in clinical signs, body weights, and necropsy findings for any of the animals in the acute and sub-chronic studies following oral administration in the rat at up to 2000   mg/kg/day YMJ. YMJ may not have any single-dose toxicity; the LD(50) of YMJ was over 2000   mg/kg, and it is safe for rats. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was considered to be 2000   mg/kg/day.

19801833|t|A possible mechanism underlying an antidepressive-like effect of Kososan, a Kampo medicine, via the hypothalamic orexinergic system in the stress-induced depression-like model mice.
19801833|a|Kososan, a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine, has an antidepressive-like effect in behavioral animal models of depression and has been used clinically for the improvement of depressive mood. However, mechanism(s) underlying the antidepressive-like effect of kososan remain unknown. Previous studies showed that orexin-A (OX-A), a neuropeptide that is involved in feeding and arousal, exhibits an antidepressive-like property via hippocampal cell proliferation. Here, we used immunohistochemical analysis with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of proliferating cells, to investigate the effect of long-term treatment with kososan on the orexinergic system and on hippocampal cell proliferation. Oral administration of kososan (1.0 g/kg) or milnacipran (60 mg/kg), a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, for 28 d led to an antidepressive-like effect in the stress-induced depression-like model mice and reversed the stress-induced decrease in the number of OX-A-positive cells in the lateral hypothalamic area. In addition, both kososan and milnacipran alleviated the stress-induced decrease in the number of BrdU-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Moreover, the antidepressive-like effect and the increase in cell proliferation and in the number of neuropeptide Y (NPY, which is closely associated with orexinergic system)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus induced by kososan were blocked by treatment with SB-334867, an orexin receptor 1 antagonist. These results suggest that kososan exerts an antidepressive-like effect via the improvement of the stress-induced decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation and that the mechanism underlying the antidepressive-like effect of kososan, but not of milnacipran, may be associated with the regulation of orexinergic and/or NPYergic transmission.

23037167|t|Involvement of neuropeptide Y signaling in the antidepressant-like effect and hippocampal cell proliferation induced by kososan, a Kampo medicine, in the stress-induced depression-like model mice.
23037167|a|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Orexin-A (OX-A), well-known neuropeptides associated with feeding and arousal, show antidepressant-like properties via hippocampal cell proliferation. Previous studies have revealed that kososan, a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine, has an antidepressant-like effect in behavioral animal models of depression; the mechanisms underlying this effect may involve the orexinergic system and subsequent upregulation of hippocampal cell proliferation. However, the roles of NPY in kososan's antidepressant-like effect remain unclear. Here we investigated whether the regulation of the NPY system could play crucial roles in this effect in the stress-induced depression-like model mice. The antidepressant-like effect of kososan administered orally (1.0 g/kg) for 28 d was abolished by a continuous intracerebroventricular injection of BIBO3304, a neuropeptide Y1 receptor antagonist, for 7 d. Likewise, BIBO3304 injection blocked the kososan-induced increases in hippocampal cell proliferation and cluster formation of neural progenitor cells. On the other hand, BIBO3304 injection did not affect kososan-induced increases in hypothalamic OX-A-producing cells or in serum OX-A levels. These results suggest that the control of the NPY system in the brain plays an essential role in kososan's antidepressant-like effect and facilitates hippocampal cell proliferation, both of which could be attributed, at least in part, to the control of the NPY system subsequent to the control of the OX-A system.

23983789|t|Microarray analysis reveals the molecular basis of antiarthritic activity of huo-luo-xiao-ling dan.
23983789|a|Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of autoimmune origin. Huo-luo-xiao-ling dan (HLXL) is an herbal mixture that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine over several decades to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including RA. However, the mechanism of the anti-arthritic action of this herbal remedy is poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, we determined by microarray analysis the effects of HLXL on the global gene expression profile of the draining lymph node cells (LNC) in the rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) model of human RA. In LNC restimulated in vitro with the disease-related antigen mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65), 84 differentially expressed genes (DEG) (64 upregulated and 20 downregulated) versus 120 DEG (94 upregulated and 26 downregulated) were identified in HLXL-treated versus vehicle (Water)-treated rats, respectively, and 62 DEG (45 upregulated and 17 downregulated) were shared between the two groups. The most affected pathways in response to HLXL treatment included immune response, inflammation, cellular proliferation and apoptosis, and metabolic processes, many of which are directly relevant to arthritis pathogenesis. These results would advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the anti-arthritic activity of HLXL.

23762133|t|Chinese Herbal Formula Huo-Luo-Xiao-Ling Dan Protects against Bone Damage in Adjuvant Arthritis by Modulating the Mediators of Bone Remodeling.
23762133|a|Huo-luo-xiao-ling dan (HLXL) is an herbal mixture that has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory disorders. Despite the availability of potent conventionally used drugs for RA, their limited efficacy in a proportion of patients coupled with their high cost and severe adverse effects has necessitated the search for novel therapeutics for this debilitating disease. Further, the control of both inflammation and bone damage is essential for effective management of arthritis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of HLXL against arthritic bone damage in adjuvant arthritis (AA) model of RA. Our results show that HLXL treatment suppressed inflammatory arthritis and reduced bone and cartilage damage in the joints of arthritic Lewis rats. HLXL-induced protection against bone damage was mediated primarily via inhibition of mediators of osteoclastic bone remodeling (e.g., receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand; RANKL), skewing of RANKL/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio in favor of antiosteoclastic activity, reduction in the number of osteoclasts in the arthrodial joint's bone, and inhibition of cytokine production and MMP activity. Our results suggest that HLXL might offer a promising alternative/adjunct treatment for both inflammation and bone damage in RA.

16946521|t|Pharmacological properties of traditional medicine (XXXII): protective effects of hangeshashinto and the combinations of its major constituents on gastric lesions in rats.
16946521|a|The protective effect of Hangeshashinto (HST) and its major constituents, baicalin (BA), berberine (BE), saponin fraction of ginseng (GS) and glycyrrhizin (GL) on rat gastric lesion induced by ethanol was examined to clarify its active ingredients and action mechanism. Oral treatment with HST at the doses of 125 and 250 mg/kg suppressed ethanol-induced gastric lesions. The mixture of BA, BE, GL and GS (4M), each of BE, GL and GS at the dosage corresponded to HST (125 mg/kg) also suppressed the ethanol-induced gastric lesion in rats, but BA did not. Treatment of ethanol augmented the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the stomach, which was significantly suppressed by the administration of HST, BE, GL and GS. These results suggest that the protective effect of HST on ethanol-induced gastric lesion was depended on BE, GL and GS, by, in part, the reduction of MPO activity in stomach.

24501112|t|Multitargeted effects of hangeshashinto for treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis on inducible prostaglandin E2 production in human oral keratinocytes.
24501112|a|OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (COM) is characterized by painful inflammation with prolonged damage that involves the pathological pain-evoking prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). We previously found that gargling with hangeshashinto (HST), a traditional Japanese medicine, was effective for the treatment of COM. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms. Our aim was to identify the active ingredients and clarify the characteristic effects of HST on the PGE2 system. METHODS: Prostanoids produced by human oral keratinocytes (HOK) stimulated with IL-1b were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Active ingredients that regulate PGE2 production were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and a culture system of HOK cells. RESULTS: Inducible PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2a, metabolites of cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, were reduced by HST (10-300   g/mL) without inducing cytotoxicity. The active ingredients of HST were quantified by LC-MS/MS, and [6]-shogaol, [6]-gingerol, wogonin, baicalein, baicalin, and berberine were shown to reduce PGE2 production. A mixture of these 6 ingredients at concentrations equal to 300   g/mL of HST strongly suppressed PGE2 production to the same level as HST. [6]-Shogaol and [6]-gingerol did not decrease COX-2 mRNA expression and mostly inhibited PGE2 metabolic activity in an assay using intact HOK cells, suggesting that they regulate PGE2 synthesis at the posttranscriptional level. Wogonin, baicalin, and berberine inhibited expression of COX-2 mRNA without affecting PGE2 metabolic activity. Moreover, wogonin, but not [6]-shogaol, suppressed phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38s and JNKs). CONCLUSIONS: These lines show that HST includes several PGE2-regulating ingredients that have different mechanisms and can function as a multicomponent and multitarget agent for treatment of COM, indicating that HST may be beneficial in a new medical strategy for COM treatment.

25883171|t|Analysis of the antioxidative function of the radioprotective Japanese traditional (Kampo) medicine, hangeshashinto, in an aqueous phase.
25883171|a|Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and painful complication of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Hangeshashinto (HST), a Japanese traditional medicine, is known to alleviate radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced OM; however, the detailed mechanism has not yet been clarified. The aim of the present study was to clarify the details of the antioxidative functions of HST against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by radiation. The hydroxyl radical (   OH)-scavenging ability and the reduction ability was simultaneously measured using a modified electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trapping method. The superoxide (O(2) (   -))-scavenging ability was estimated by an EPR redox probing method. Water suspensions of powdered HST and of its seven constitutive crude drugs were tested. In addition, some of the main water-soluble ingredients of the crude drugs were also tested. HST was found to scavenge both    OH and O(2) (   -). Furthermore, HST was observed to reduce relatively stable nitroxyl radicals. Glycyrrhizae Radix (kanzo), Ginseng Radix (ninjin), Zizyphi Fructus (taiso) and glycyrrhizin (an ingredient of kanzo) were all found to be relatively good    OH scavengers. Scutellariae Radix (ogon) and Coptidis Rhizoma (oren) demonstrated reducing ability. In addition, acteoside and berberine chloride, which are water-soluble ingredients of ogon and oren, respectively, also demonstrated reducing ability. Oren exhibited oxidative ability at higher concentrations, which may have a function in maintaining catalytic redox action. The antioxidative function of HST probably worked via a balance of scavenging ROS, reducing stable free radicals, and some minor oxidizing activities.

26878477|t|The traditional Japanese medicine hangeshashinto alleviates oral ulcer-induced pain in a rat model.
26878477|a|OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that mouthwash made with the traditional Japanese medicine hangeshashinto exhibits anti-inflammatory action and alleviates oral mucositis scores, including pain complaints, in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy. However, no study has demonstrated the mechanism underlying how hangeshashinto provides pain relief in oral ulcers. DESIGN: The analgesic effects on pain-related behaviors following the topical application of hangeshashinto were evaluated in an oral ulcer rat model treated with acetic acid using recently developed methods. Indomethacin, the representative anti-inflammatory agent, was intraperitoneally administered. The tissue permeability of the oral mucosa was histologically evaluated after applying the fluorescent substance FluoroGold. RESULTS: The topical application of hangeshashinto in ulcerative oral mucosa suppressed mechanical pain hypersensitivity over 60min, without any effects on healthy mucosa. The same drug application also inhibited oral ulcer-induced spontaneous pain. Indomethacin administration failed to block the mechanical pain hypersensitivity, though it did largely block spontaneous pain. Topical anesthesia with lidocaine showed hyposensitivity to mechanical stimulation in healthy mucosa. In the ulcer regions in which the oral epithelial barrier was destroyed, deep parenchyma was stained with FluoroGold, in contrast to healthy oral mucosa, in which staining was limiting to the superficial site. CONCLUSIONS: Hangeshashinto leads to long-lasting analgesic effects, specifically in the ulcer region by destroying the epithelial barrier. Hangeshashinto alleviates oral ulcer-induced pain in inflammation-dependent and/or independent manner.

24652604|t|Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II study of TJ-14 (hangeshashinto) for gastric cancer chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis.
24652604|a|BACKGROUND: Hangeshashinto (TJ-14, a Kampo medicine), which reduces the level of prostaglandin E2 and affects the cyclooxygenase activity, alleviates chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (COM). We conducted a randomized comparative trial to investigate whether TJ-14 prevents and controls COM in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with gastric cancer who developed moderate-to-severe oral mucositis (CTCAE v4.0 grade    1) during any cycle of chemotherapy to receive either TJ-14 or a placebo as a double-blind trial. The patients received a placebo or TJ-14 for 2-6 weeks according to the chemotherapy regimen from the beginning of the next course of chemotherapy. The primary end point was the incidence of grade    2 oral mucositis in the protocol treatment course, and the secondary end points were the time to disappearance of oral mucositis and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: Following the key opening of the blinding protocol, we analyzed 91 eligible patients (TJ-14: 45, placebo: 46) using a "per protocol set" analysis. The incidence of    grade 2 COM was 40.0 % in the TJ-14 group and 41.3 % in the placebo group (p = 0.588). The median duration of    grade 2 COM was 14 days in the TJ-14 group and 16 days in the placebo group (p = 0.894). Meanwhile, the median duration of any grade of COM was 9 days in the TJ-14 group and 17 days in the placebo group among the patients who developed grade 1 symptoms during the screening cycle [hazard ratio 0.60; 95 % CI (0.23-1.59), p = 0.290]. CONCLUSIONS: Although TJ-14 treatment did not reduce the incidence of >= 2 COM in the patients who developed mucositis during chemotherapy for gastric cancer, a trend was observed in which TJ-14 reduced the risk of COM in the patients who developed grade 1 COM during the screening cycle. Further, phase III studies with a larger sample size are needed to clarify the protective effects of TJ-14 for COM.

22073616|a|We report a case of drug-induced pneumonitis caused by saikokeishikankyoto. A 68-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of dry cough, fever, and dyspnea after taking saikokeishikankyoto for 16 days. A chest radiograph showed widespread ground-glass shadows in both lung fields. Chest CT showed ground-glass opacities and thickening of the interlobular septum in both lung fields. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and transbronchial lung biopsy specimen showed findings consistent with drug-induced pneumonitis, therefore we diagnosed drug-induced pneumonitis caused by saikokeishikankyoto. Three years previously she had suffered from a similar illness after taking hangeshashinto. Ougon is suspected to be a causative component for her saikokeishikankyoto-induced pneumonitis, because it has been reported to be as a main cause for kampo-induced pneumonitis.

24620820|t|Risk factors for pseudoaldosteronism with rhabdomyolysis caused by consumption of drugs containing licorice and differences between incidence of these conditions in Japan and other countries: case report and literature review.
24620820|a|BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism is thought to involve the inhibition of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 by glycyrrhetinic acid. Some risk factors have been reported, but differences between Japan and other countries have not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old woman was hospitalized because of pseudoaldosteronism with rhabdomyolysis caused by ingestion of herbal medicines containing licorice. She had been prescribed shakuyakukanzobushito (decocted, 3 g of licorice) and keishikajutsubuto (decocted, 2 g of licorice) for the treatment of lower back pain and had been taking antihypertensive agents for the treatment of essential hypertension. After taking the herbal medicines for 2 weeks, the patient developed weakness of the extremities and pain in both thighs. On admission, she had hypertension, oliguria, an elevated serum creatine kinase level, hypokalemia, alkalemia associated with metabolic alkalosis, low plasma renin activity, and low plasma aldosterone levels. Intravenous and oral potassium supplementation and the administration of spironolactone resulted in the normalization of her condition within approximately 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: An analysis of case reports of pseudoaldosteronism with rhabdomyolysis revealed that in Japan, most cases occurred in elderly women with essential hypertension and were caused by drugs such as herbal medicines. In contrast, in other countries, many cases involved younger men, and the dominant causes were foods containing licorice. The use of herbal medicines is increasing all over the world, and when a patient with risk factors is prescribed an herbal medicine containing licorice, careful follow-up is required.

24473591|t|Chinese herbal medicine for functional constipation: a randomised controlled trial.
24473591|a|1. This was an 18-week prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study on a Chinese herbal medicine--ma zi ren wan (MZRW)--for the treatment of functional constipation. 2. 120 subjects with functional constipation (Rome III criteria) were randomised (60 per arm) into the MZRW and placebo groups. Respective responder rates for the two groups were 43.3% and 8.3% during treatment, and 30.0% and 15.0% in the follow-up period (p<0.05). The MZRW group was superior to the placebo group in terms of increased complete spontaneous bowel movement as well as reduction in severity of constipation, straining at evacuation, and use of rescue therapy. No serious adverse effects were reported. 3. The dose of MZRW (7.5 g bid) was determined in a separate clinical trial. This study entailed a dose determination study and then a placebo-controlled clinical trial and can be a good reference for future studies.

27699020|t|Efficacy of daiokanzoto in chronic constipation refractory to first-line laxatives.
27699020|a|UNASSIGNED: There are only a few treatment options for constipation and limited evidence of suitable treatments. Daiokanzoto (DKT) is a Kampo medicine often used clincally to treat constipation. DKT is a laxative used predominantly in Japan; however, clinical data on its efficacy and safety is lacking. Patients who used DKT, but were intolerant to either magnesium oxide (MgO; MgO group; n=16) or senna extract (Senna group; n=26) were included in the present study. The frequencies of their bowel movements were compared during the 1 week prior to and following DKT administration. Within 24 hours after DKT administration, 93.8% of the patients in the MgO group evacuated their bowels. The median bowel movement frequency 1 week prior to DKT administration was 2.5 and 1 week after DKT administration was significantly increased to 7.5. In the Senna group, within 24 h of DKT administration, 80.8% of the patients evacuated their bowels. The median bowel movement frequency 1 week prior to the DKT treatment was 2.0, which significantly increased to 8.5 1 week after the administration of DKT. The adverse events from DKT treatment were mild and controllable.

21881253|t|High-performance liquid chromatographic determination and metabolic study of sennoside a in daiokanzoto by mouse intestinal bacteria.
21881253|a|Daiokanzoto (DKT, combination of rhubarb and glycyrrhiza), a Kampo medicine, is clinically effective for constipation. Sennoside A is well known to induce diarrhea. Sennoside A is a prodrug that is transformed into an active metabolite, rheinanthrone, by intestinal bacteria. In this study, we investigated the effects of glycyrrhiza on the activity of sennoside A metabolism in intestinal bacteria using mouse feces. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the determination of sennoside A in incubation mixture of DKT with mouse feces was established. The retention time of sennoside A was 9.26  0.02 min with a TSKgel ODS-80TsQA column by linear gradient elution using a mobile phase containing aqueous phosphoric acid and acetonitrile and detection at 265 nm. We found that the activity of sennoside A metabolism in intestinal bacteria was significantly accelerated when glycyrrhiza, liquiritin or liquiritin apioside coexisted with sennoside A, whereas that of glycyrrhizin was not altered. This method is applicable for determination of the activity of sennoside A metabolism by anaerobic incubation of DKT with mouse feces.

23207772|t|The influence of rhein 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside on the purgative action of sennoside A from rhubarb in mice.
23207772|a|Rhubarb is one of the most well-known herbal medicines that constitute daiokanzoto (DKT), which is clinically effective for constipation. Sennoside A is transformed into an active metabolite, rheinanthrone, by intestinal bacteria. Sennoside A in rhubarb showed significantly accelerated metabolic activity in intestinal bacteria in comparison with sennoside A alone. In this study, we investigated the influence of rhubarb constituents on the metabolism and purgative activity of sennoside A. The 20% MeOH-eluted fraction separated by MCI-gel CHP-20P column chromatography from the water extract of rhubarb showed sennoside A metabolic activity similar to that of rhubarb extract. The 20% MeOH elute was further purified and rhein 8-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (RG) was isolated. The metabolic activity of sennoside A was significantly accelerated by increasing the level of RG. Moreover, rhein, emodin and aloe-emodin also accelerated sennoside A metabolism. The purgative activity of sennoside A was significantly accelerated when RG or rhein was concomitantly given with sennoside A in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that anthraquinones contribute to the purgative action of sennoside A in rhubarb. Therefore, it is assumed that the influence of anthraquinones on the fate of rheinanthrone transformed from sennoside A may promote the purgative action of sennoside A.

23373442|t|Study to establish Ojeok-San (Five Accumulation Powder: wu ji san) administration criteria and a questionnaire to evaluate the holistic effects of Ojeok-San on patients with low back pain.
23373442|a|OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to establish ojeok-san (Five Accumulation Powder: wu ji san) administration criteria and a questionnaire to evaluate the holistic effects of ojeok-san on patients with low back pain (LBP). METHODS: Texts and literatures, recommended by specialists, were searched to gather ojeok-san-related symptoms. Then, the opinions of Oriental medicine doctors (OMDs) practicing in Seoul were surveyed to ask which symptoms they consider the most in clinical practice. Based on the survey, selection of potential items for the questionnaire was made. The final version was established based on the results of the survey and Delphi process of musculoskeletal diseases specialists. In order to evaluate the reliability and validity of the newly developed assessment tool (Ojeok-san Low Back Questionnaire: OLQ), patients with chronic LBP were recruited. OLQ and other tools such as visual analogue scale, numeric rating scale, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Modified-Modified Schober test, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were applied to the subjects in a 2-week interval. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and convergent and discrimination validity were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 90 potential items were generated by the research team. One hundred and two (102) OMDs fully replied to the survey. Based on the survey results, 34 items were initially selected as potential items. Through Delphi method of experts, 10 top items, rated more than 5 points on a scale of 10, were finally established. The 10 items were each established as a response scale of 0-10 (0 as no symptom and 10 as the most excessive form of symptom). Based on the above stages, an initial OLQ was established and used in the evaluation phase. The validity and reliability of OLQ assessment results showed high test-retest reliability, intraclass correlation coefficient, and internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed Ojeok-san administration criteria and questionnaire may be a promising tool for future Oriental medicine clinical study protocols.

24278839|t|Kampo Extract of Shinbuto Improved Refractory Diarrhea in Milroy's Disease.
24278839|a|Milroy's disease is a hereditary congenital lymphedema caused by lymphatic obstruction. The legs are most commonly affected, but impaired intestinal lymphatic flow can cause loose bowel movements. Here, we report the use of the Kampo extract of shinbuto for successful treatment of and abdominal pain in a patient with Milroy's disease. Milroy's disease was diagnosed because of left leg lymph-edema with onset at birth. Conservative therapy with a compression bandage was applied. However, when the patient moved to Manila at 35 years of age, she was exposed to drastic temperature changes between the air-conditioned cold environment in her room and the hot and humid environment outside. She developed a constitutional state of coldness as in hiesho (   ). Then sudden lower abdominal pain and diarrhea began to occur 3 times per week and lasted at least 1 hour, sometimes accompanied by vomiting. It happened particularly when she was exposed to the cold environment and was not related to meals. Conventional anti-cholinergic or antidiarrhetic drugs had no therapeutic effect. These attacks continued in the same frequency for 3 years, so the patient visited a Kampo (traditional Japanese medicine) clinic, where her diagnosis of Milroy's disease-associated diarrhea and abdominal pain was augmented by the Kampo diagnosis of hiesho, suitai (body fluid retention). She was prescribed 7.5 g of shinbuto extract per day (TJ-30; Tsumura Co, Tokyo, Japan). The shinbuto extract significantly reduced abdominal pain and refractory diarrhea to about 2 days per month, and it tapered off completely in 3 months. Shinbuto is usually used against cold-induced diarrhea. Rewarming and water movement by shinbuto resulted in significant improvement in symptoms induced by hiesho and suitai triggered by the cold environment, though the patient's leg swelling did not change.

17965764|t|Vascular pharmacology of mokuboito (mu-fang-yi-tang) and its constituents on the smooth muscle and the endothelium in rat aorta.
17965764|a|Pharmacological actions of Mokuboito and its constituents (Sinomenium acutum and sinomenine) on rat aorta were examined. Mokuboito and S. acutum at lower concentrations (0.03-1 mg ml(-1)) contracted the non-loaded aorta, but at higher concentrations (1-3 mg ml(-1)), reversed to dilate it. The vasoconstriction was blocked by phentolamine (10 muM). Sinomenine failed to exhibit the vasoconstriction. On the other hand, Mokuboito and S. acutum dilated the NE (5 muM)-induced vasoconstriction: at 3 mg ml(-1), by 98.9 +/- 2.5% (n = 6, P < 0.01) and 97.0 +/- 4.8% (n = 6, P < 0.01). Vasorelaxation induced by Mokuboito and S. acutum was attenuated by indomethacin, L-NMMA and nicardipine. Propranolol decreased the vasorelaxation induced by Mokuboito, but not by S. acutum. Sinomenine also relaxed the constriction and at 100 muM, by 68.8 +/- 5.1% (n = 7, P < 0.01). This vasorelaxation was attenuated by indomethacin, L-NMMA and nicardipine, and also by propranolol. Therefore, these results indicate that Mokuboito and its constituents exert both vasodilating actions mediated by endothelium-dependent mechanisms (PGI(2) and NO from endothelium) and by endothelium-independent mechanisms (Ca(2+) influx control on smooth muscle cells). Simultaneously, Mokuboito and S. acutum cause the vasoconstrictions mediated through alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, but not sinomenine. Also, Mokuboito and sinomenine possess beta-adrenoreceptor stimulating action, but not S. acutum.

15844319|t|Effects of prostaglandin E1 on the progression of aristolochic acid nephropathy.
15844319|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on the progression of aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN). METHODS: Twenty-four patients diagnosed as AAN with serum creatinine (Scr) between 1.5 mg/dL and 4 mg/dL during September 2001 to August 2003 were randomly divided into 2 groups. All patients had ingested long dan xie gan wan containing aristolochic acid (0.219 mg/g) for at least 3 months. Twelve patients were injected with Alprostadil (10 microg/d for 10 days in one month, summing up to 6 months). Except for PGE1, the other therapy was same in both groups. Renal function was assessed using reciprocal serum creatinine levels (1/Scr). RESULTS: The level of Scr an d serum hemoglobin (Hgb) was similar in both groups prior to therapy. During follow-up, 1/Scr levels in PGE1 group were significantly higher than control group (P < 0.01), and Hgb levels in PGE1 group were significantly increased compared with control (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PGE1 can slow the progression of renal failure and increase Hgb level of AAN patient.

27106030|a|UNASSIGNED: Tension-type headache is the most frequent form of headache. The local topical treatment with peppermint oil (oleum menthae piperitae) has proven to be significantly more effective than placebo in controlled studies. Peppermint oil targets headache pathophysiology in multiple ways. The efficacy is comparable to that of acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol. Solutions of 10   % peppermint oil in ethanol are licensed for the treatment of tension-type headache in adults and children above 6  years. It is included in treatment recommendations and guidelines by the respective professional societies and is regarded as a standard treatment for the acute therapy of tension-type headaches.

24121454|t|Goshajinkigan oxaliplatin neurotoxicity evaluation (GONE): a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double  -blind, placebo  -controlled trial of goshajinkigan to prevent oxaliplatin  -induced neuropathy.
24121454|a|PURPOSE: Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (OPN) is frequent and potentially severe, but successful treatment of this condition is still an unmet clinical need. We aimed to determine whether treatment with goshajinkigan (TJ-107), a traditional Japanese medicine, is better than placebo in preventing OPN in patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer patients treated with standard FOLFOX regimens. METHODS: In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients undergoing oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were randomized to receive either oral TJ-107 (7.5 g) or matching placebo daily. The severity of OPN was assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events at baseline, every 2 weeks until the 8th cycle, and every 4 weeks thereafter until the 26th week. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 2 or greater OPN until the 8th cycle of chemotherapy. RESULTS: Analyses were done by intention to treat. Eighty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive either TJ-107 (n = 44) or placebo (n = 45) between May 2009 and March 2010. The incidence of grade 2 or greater OPN until the 8th cycle was 39 and 51 % in the TJ-107 and placebo groups, respectively (relative risk (RR), 0.76; 95 % CI, 0.47   1.21). The incidence of grade 3 OPN was 7 % (TJ-107) vs. 13 % (placebo) (0.51, 0.14   1.92). No concerns regarding toxicity emerged with TJ-107 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: TJ-107 appears to have an acceptable safety margin and a promising effect in delaying the onset of grade 2 or greater OPN without impairing FOLFOX efficacy.

24812564|t|Long-term effects of goshajinkigan in prevention of diabetic complications: a randomized open-labeled clinical trial.
24812564|a|Objective. This clinical trial was designed to investigate whether goshajinkigan reduces the onset of diabetic complications or not. Materials and Methods. A total of 332 type 2 diabetic mellitus patients were registered from 9 clinical centers from March 2000 to August 2007. Patients were randomly assigned to take goshajinkigan extract powder, 2.5 grams for 3 times a day or no kampo therapy, additionally to the regular treatment. The primary endpoints were the onset of macrovascular diseases or progression of nephropathy or retinopathy. Statistical analysis was performed by the intention-to-treat method. Results. After 5 years of observation, 116 patients were submitted to analysis. Among them, no macrovascular events were observed in both groups. Although 43 participants had upstaging of retinopathy or nephropathy in total, there was no significant difference between goshajinkigan group and control group. Deterioration of ankle reflex was suppressed in goshajinkigan group. Also glycated hemoglobin, and fasting plasma glucose were decreased in the goshajinkigan group. Conclusion. Although the power of analysis was too low to demonstrate any effects of goshajinkigan on the progression of macrovascular diseases, retinopathy or nephropathy, goshajinkigan may be beneficial for diabetic neuropathy and glycemic control.

6528851|a|No study has been reported of the effects of Goshajinkigan on male infertility. Thirty infertile male patients were orally given Goshajinkigan at a daily dose of 5.0 g for three months or more. Sixteen of these patients showed significant improvement in sperm motility. Ten cases showed effective increase in sperm count. Only one patients became pregnant during the period of administration of this drug. Laboratory examination showed no significant change in serum LH, serum FSH or prostaglandin E in seminal fluid. These results suggest that administration of TSUMURA-Goshajinkigan is effective as therapy for male infertility, but how this drug may be involved in promoting fertility should be investigated in future.

12723759|t|Effects of goshajinkigan on corneal sensitivity, superficial punctate keratopathy and tear secretion in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
12723759|a|Goshajinkigan (niu-che-shen-qi-wan in Chinese), a traditional herbal medicine, has been used in Japan to treat clinical symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. A double-masked study was performed to evaluate its effects on corneal sensitivity, superficial punctate keratopathy and tear production in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Fifty diabetic patients were randomized into two groups: Group A, in which 25 patients received goshajinkigan orally, 7.5 g/day for 3 months; Group B, in which 25 patients were orally administered placebo, 6.0 g/day for 3 months; and in Group C, 25 non-diabetic subjects were orally administered goshajinkigan, 7.5 g/day for 3 months. Corneal sensitivity was measured with an aesthesiometer. The area of superficial punctate keratopathy was expressed as a fluorescein staining score. Reflex tearing was determined with a Schirmer test without anesthesia goshajinkigan was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Corneal thresholds after treatment with goshajinkigan (2.03 g/mm2) in Group A were significantly lower than those before treatment (2.47 g/mm2). Those in Groups B and C did not change after treatment. Fluorescein staining scores after administration of Goshajinkigan (0.64) in Group A were significantly lower than those before treatment (1.32). Those in Groups B and C did not change after treatment. Schirmer test results after goshajinkigan administration (11.0 mm/5 min) in Group A were significantly higher than those before treatment (9.3 mm/5 min). Those in Groups B and C did not change after treatment. Hemoglobin A1c levels in Groups A, B,and C did not change after treatment. Several components in goshajinkigan were found on high performance liquid chromatography. In conclusion, goshajinkigan improved ocular surface disorders in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

16552839|t|Effects of goshajinkigan (niu-che-sen-qi-wan) for resiniferatoxin-sensitive afferents on detrusor overactivity induced by acetic acid in conscious rats.
16552839|a|This study was performed to investigate the effects of goshajinkigan, a traditional Chinese herbal mixture, in conscious rats undergoing continuous cystometry. Systemic resiniferatoxin (RTX) pretreatment can block resiniferatoxin-sensitive (C-fiber) nerve-mediated bladder overactivity, such as that induced by intravesical administration of acetic acid. The effects of pretreatment with goshajinkigan and RTX alone or in combination on acetic acid-induced bladder overactivity in conscious rats were also compared. Female SD rats were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 3 received normal food for 4 weeks, while groups 2 and 4 received goshajinkigan (0.09 g/kg/day) during the same period. Two days after bladder catheterization, groups 3 and 4 received RTX (0.3 mg/kg) injection, while groups 1 and 2 received vehicle alone. Cystometric investigations were performed on all animals 24 hours after RTX or vehicle injection. The effects of intravesical instillation of acetic acid (pH = 4.0) were compared with those of intravesical saline. Goshajinkigan significantly increased threshold pressure, voiding interval, micturition volume, and bladder capacity. Intravesical instillation of acetic acid induced bladder overactivity in both normal rats and in those pretreated with goshajinkigan. However, the effects of acetic acid on voiding interval and micturition volume were significantly different between rats given normal diet and those pretreated with goshajinkigan. The effect of acetic acid was not different between goshajinkigan- and RTX-pretreated rats. The results of the present study indicated that goshajinkigan increases voiding interval, micturition volume, and bladder capacity, and pretreatment with goshajinkigan partially blocks the bladder overactivity induced by intravesical administration of acetic acid in rats.

17687217|t|[A case of neurotoxicity reduced with goshajinkigan in modified FOLFOX6 chemotherapy for advanced colon cancer].
17687217|a|In performing FOLFOX (infusional 5-FU/LV with oxaliplatin) for advanced colorectal cancer, neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is the serious dose limiting factor. On the other hand, goshajinkigan is recently considered as an effective agent for the neurotoxicity of taxanes in Japan. We have applied goshajinkigan (TJ 107) for a case of advanced colon cancer with mFOLFOX 6, and experienced a reduction in numbness, the adverse effect of LOHP. A 57-year-old woman with descending colon cancer (H 1, P 3, Stage IV) underwent hemicolectomy D 2, rt.colectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, cholecystectomy and transverse colonostomy. After operation, mFOLFOX 6 was applied. In order to reduce the neurotoxicity of L-OHP, TJ 107 was used together from the third course. The severities of neurotoxicity before and after administration of TJ 107 were grade 2 and 1,respectively. TJ 107 could reduce or prevent the neurotoxicity of L-OHP.

25379475|t|Effects of goshajinkigan, hachimijiogan, and rokumigan on mechanical allodynia induced by Paclitaxel in mice.
25379475|a|Peripheral neuropathy is a major dose-limiting side effect of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. This study examined whether the three related traditional herbal formulations, goshajinkigan (GJG; Ni   Ch   Sh  n Q   W  n), hachimijiogan (HJG; B   W  i D   Hu  ng W  n), and rokumigan (RMG; Li   W  i W  n), would relieve paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia in mice. A single intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) induced mechanical allodynia, which peaked on day 14 after injection. On day 14 after paclitaxel injection, oral administration of GJG (0.1-1.0 g/kg) produced a significant inhibition of established allodynia, but HJG and RMG did not affect the allodynia. Repeated oral administration of GJG (0.1-1.0 g/kg) starting from the day after paclitaxel injection did not affect allodynia development, but significantly inhibited allodynia exacerbation. Repeated oral administration of HJG produced a slight inhibition of allodynia exacerbation, but that of RMG did not. These results suggest that prophylactic administration of GJG is effective in preventing the exacerbation of paclitaxel-induced allodynia. The herbal medicines Plantaginis Semen ( Ch   Qi  n Z  ) and Achyranthis Radix ( Ni   X  ), which are present in GJG but not in HJG, may contribute to the inhibitory action of GJG on the exacerbation of paclitaxel-induced allodynia.

24307899|t|Efficacy of goshajinkigan for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in colorectal cancer patients.
24307899|a|Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of Goshajinkigan for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in colorectal cancer patients. Patients. Colorectal cancer patients (N = 29) who received >= 4 weeks of Goshajinkigan for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy during chemotherapy at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine were (Goshajinkigan group) compared to 44 patients who had not received Goshajinkigan during the same period (non-Goshajinkigan group). Main Outcome Measures. The effect of Goshajinkigan was graded as curative, effective, stabilizing, or deleterious. The relationships between the grade of peripheral neuropathy and the dose of oxaliplatin in the Goshajinkigan and non-Goshajinkigan groups were evaluated. Results. The effect of Goshajinkigan on peripheral neuropathy in the Goshajinkigan group was curative, effective, stabilizing, and deleterious in 3.4, 20.7, 69.0, and 6.9% of patients, compared to the effect in the non-Goshajinkigan group (4.5, 15.9, 45.5, and 34.1%). The ratio of deleterious effects was significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.04). A Kaplan-Meier analysis in relation to the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin showed that the incidence of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy tended to be less in the Goshajinkigan group (P = 0.05). There were no significant differences in time to treatment failure and severe adverse events between these two groups. Conclusions. Goshajinkigan prevented exacerbation of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. This trial is registered with UMIN000009956.

19952054|t|Efficacy of goshajinkigan for peripheral neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin in patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.
19952054|a|Peripheral neurotoxicity is the major limiting factor for oxaliplatin therapy. Goshajinkigan (GJG), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, was recently shown to be effective in protecting against the neurotoxicity of taxanes in Japan. We retrospectively investigated the effect of GJG on peripheral neurotoxicity associated with oxaliplatin therapy. Ninety patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that received FOLFOX4 or modified FOLFOX6 therapy were assigned to receive one of the following adjuncts: oral GJG at 7.5   g day(-1) (Group A, n = 11), intravenous supplementation of calcium gluconate and magnesium sulfate (1   g each before and after FOLFOX) (Group B, n = 14), combined GJG and calcium gluconate and magnesium sulfate therapies (Group C, n = 21), or no concomitant therapy (Group D, n = 44). The incidence of peripheral neurotoxicity was investigated when the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin exceeded 500   mg   m(-2). When the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin exceeded 500   mg   m(-2), the incidence of neuropathy (all grades) in Groups A-D was 50.0%, 100%, 78.9%, and 91.7%, respectively. It was lowest in the group that received GJG alone. Concomitant administration of GJG reduced the neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin in patients that received chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.

26542342|t|Preventive effect of oral goshajinkigan on chronic oxaliplatin-induced hypoesthesia in rats.
26542342|a|Oxaliplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, induces peripheral neuropathy that manifests itself as two distinct phases: acute cold hyperesthesia and chronic peripheral hypoesthesia/dysesthesia. The latter is a serious dose-limiting side effect that can often lead to withdrawal of treatment. We have developed a rat model expressing both phases and used the model to investigate the action of goshajinkigan (GJG), a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, which was reported to ameliorate oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized phase II study. In this study, neuropathy was induced by injection of oxaliplatin twice weekly for 8 wks. The maximum level of cold hyperesthesia was observed at 4 wks with heat hypoesthesia developing later. Microscopy studies revealed atrophy of axons of myelinated sciatic nerve fibers in oxaliplatin-treated rats at 8 wks. Co-administration of GJG ameliorated both abnormal sensations as well as histological damage to the sciatic nerve. A pharmacokinetic study revealed numerous neuroprotective components of GJG that are rapidly absorbed into the blood. GJG and some of its components attenuated the generation of oxaliplatin-induced reactive oxygen species, which is a possible mechanism of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity. The present study provides a useful animal model for oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity as well as a promising prophylactic agent.

25240613|t|The prophylactic effects of a traditional Japanese medicine, goshajinkigan, on paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy and its mechanism of action.
25240613|a|BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effect of goshajinkigan (GJG) on paclitaxel (PTX)-induced neuropathy and to elucidate the mechanism of action. RESULTS: There was a time-dependent irreversible decrease in pain threshold in PTX group. In PTX/GJG group, pain threshold showed changes in the same level as control. Electron microscope showed that although the ganglion cells of control and PTX/GJG groups were normal, degeneration of the nucleus and swelling of the mitochondria were observed in PTX group. Expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) gene in PTX group significantly increased compared with that in control and PTX/GJG groups. In TRPV4 knock-out mice, no PTX-induced hyperalgesia was observed, and there was no significant difference in pain threshold between the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that PTX induced hyperalgesia by enhancing TRPV4 expression, and suggested that GJG might alleviate hyperalgesia by preventing degeneration of the ganglion cells and suppressing TRPV4 expression.

23268961|a|This study was designed to investigate the effect of an herbal medicine-goshajinkigan (GJ)-on the regulation of total body weight, as well as liver and adipose tissue weights in rats fed a highfat diet (HFD) and drinking of 30% sucrose (HFDS) (HFD; the rats received 19.6% energy from carbohydrates, 18.2% from proteins, and 62.2% from lipids; total energy, 506 kcal/100 g). Control rats were fed a standard diet (the rats received 60.5% energy from carbohydrates, 26.2% from proteins, and 13.3% from lipids; total energy, 360 kcal/100 g). Over a period of 12 weeks, rats were allowed free access to either the standard diet or HFDS containing 0, 1, or 3% GJ. In comparison with the control group, the HFDS rats showed a significant decrease in overall body weight and adipose tissue weight, and an increase in liver weight at 12 weeks. GJ treatment significantly reversed the HFDS-induced decrease in body and adipose tissue weight and reduced the elevated liver weight dose-dependently. Similarly, GJ reduced the elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels observed in HFDS rats. These results suggest that GJ may have the potential to alleviate damage to the liver in subjects with long-term consumption of HFDS.

27416484|t|An effective therapeutic approach for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy using a combination therapy with goshajinkigan and bushi.
27416484|a|UNASSIGNED: Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) occurs at extraordinarily high frequency, but no effective treatment for this disorder has been established. Goshajinkigan (GJG), a traditional Japanese medicine known as Kampo, is known to reduce OIPN in both basic and clinical studies. However, its molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of GJG against OIPN and the therapeutic benefits of combining GJG with bushi, a herbal medicine derived from the processed Aconiti tuber. Oxaliplatin (4  mg/kg) was injected into mice twice a week for up to 4 and 3 weeks, respectively. OIPN was assessed using pain behavioral tests, such as those testing cold hypersensitivity, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia, as well as a reduction of the current perception threshold (CPT). GJG (0.3 or 1  g/kg) and bushi (0.1 or 0.3  g/kg) were orally administered 5  times a week for 4 weeks. Behavioral analysis was performed 24  h after the final dose. Oxaliplatin induced cold hypersensitivity and mechanical allodynia but not thermal hyperalgesia and reduced CPT of A  - and Ab-fibers but not C-fibers. All these effects were counteracted by GJG. Bushi, an ingredient of GJG that shows analgesic effect, reduced oxaliplatin-induced cold hypersensitivity but had no effect on oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia. However, bushi significantly accentuated the effects of GJG when co-administered with GJG. GJG reduces OIPN by counteracting the sensitization of A  - and Ab-fibers and shows analgesic effects against cold hypersensitivity and mechanical allodynia. These effects are potentiated by bushi. The combination of GJG with bushi has high potential for preventing OIPN.

7705193|t|The effects of goshajinkigan, a herbal medicine, on subjective symptoms and vibratory threshold in patients with diabetic neuropathy.
7705193|a|Goshajinkigan, a herbal medicine, has long been used in Japan to alleviate the subjective symptoms of diabetic neuropathy; however, its effects have not been confirmed objectively. We evaluated its effects on subjective symptoms and on vibration sensation in patients with diabetic neuropathy. The oral administration of 7.5 g/day of Goshajinkigan for 3 months (treatment period) relieved subjective symptoms of numbness in 9 of 13 patients. When the drug was discontinued for 2 months as a washout period, the subjective symptom worsened in 7 of 13 patients. Chi-square analysis revealed significant effects of Goshajiniagan on subjective symptoms (P < 0.001 for numbness and P < 0.05 for cold sensation). Vibration sensation was evaluated by measuring vibratory threshold using an SMV-5 vibrometer. There were significant changes in vibratory thresholds by paired t-test (P < 0.05) both in the upper and the lower extremities during the treatment and washout periods. Chi-square analysis also revealed a significant effect of Goshajinkigan on vibratory threshold (P < 0.01). There was no significant change in glycosylated hemoglobin as a whole during the study. These observations confirm that Goshajinkigan relieves subjective symptoms and demonstrate that it improves vibration sensation in patients with diabetic neuropathy.

27419098|t|Prophylactic administration of an extract from Plantaginis Semen and its major component aucubin inhibits mechanical allodynia caused by paclitaxel in mice.
27419098|a|The chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX) causes peripheral neuropathy as a major dose-limiting side effect, and this peripheral neuropathy is difficult to control. Our previous report showed that prophylactic repetitive administration of goshajinkigan ( ni   ch   sh  n q   w  n), but not hachimijiogan ( b   w  i d   hu  ng w  n), which lacks two of the constituents of goshajinkigan, inhibited PTX-induced mechanical allodynia in mice. Thus, the herbal medicines Plantaginis Semen ( ch   qi  n z  ) or Achyranthis Radix ( ni   x  ) may contribute to the inhibitory action of goshajinkigan on the exacerbation of PTX-induced mechanical allodynia [Andoh et  al, J. Tradit. Complement. Med. 2014; 4: 293-297]. Therefore, in this study, we examined whether an extract of Plantaginis Semen (EPS) or Achyranthis Radix (EAR) would relieve PTX-induced mechanical allodynia in mice. A single intraperitoneal injection of PTX caused mechanical allodynia, which peaked on day 14 after injection. Repetitive oral administration of EPS, but not EAR, starting from the day after PTX injection significantly inhibited the exacerbation of PTX-induced mechanical allodynia. Repetitive intraperitoneal injection of aucubin, one of the main components of EPS, starting from the day after PTX injection also significantly reduced PTX-induced mechanical allodynia. However, repetitive intraperitoneal injection of geniposide acid (a precursor of aucubin) or catalpol (a metabolite of aucubin) did not prevent the exacerbation of mechanical allodynia. These results suggest that prophylactic administration of EPS is effective for preventing the exacerbation of PTX-induced allodynia. Aucubin may contribute to the inhibitory action of EPS on the exacerbation of PTX-induced allodynia.

26652982|t|Natural products and complementary therapies for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: A systematic review.
26652982|a|UNASSIGNED: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a serious dose-limiting side-effect without any FDA-approved treatment option. Prior reviews focus mostly on pharmacological interventions, but nonpharmaceutical interventions have also been evaluated. A Web of Science and PubMed database search to identify relevant RCTs from January 2005 to May 2015 included the terms: CIPN, cancer; and supplements, vitamin E, goshajinkigan, kampo, acetyl-l-carnitine, carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, omega-3, glutamine, or glutamate; or massage, acupuncture, mind-body practice, yoga, meditation, Tai-Chi, physical activity, or exercise. Of 1465 publications screened, 12 RCTs evaluated natural products and one evaluated electroacupuncture. Vitamin E may help prevent CIPN. l-Glutamine, goshajinkigan, and omega-3 are also promising. Acetyl-l-carnitine may worsen CIPN and alpha-lipoic acid activity is unknown. Electroacupuncture was not superior to placebo. No RCTs were published regarding other complementary therapies, although some studies mention positive incidental findings. Natural products and complementary therapies deserve further investigation, given the lack of effective CIPN interventions.

25075049|t|Management of peripheral neuropathy induced by nab-paclitaxel treatment for breast cancer.
25075049|a|Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is a key drug used in breast cancer treatment which often causes chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). No effective approach for CIPN control has been established to date. This study assessed a new approach to CIPN integrating two concepts: compression therapy using stockings and sleeves, and medication therapy using selected prophylactic drugs, including goshajinkigan, which we named the "3S" approach. Fourteen breast cancer patients were divided into a 3S group (n=7) and a control group (n=7), and were treated with 260 mg/m(2) of nab-PTX once every three weeks. CIPN initially developed in five control-group patients and one 3S-group patient (p=0.03). Across all cycles, the CIPN grades, as determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), were significantly lower in the 3S group than in the control group (p<0.001). The mean nab-PTX dose in the 3S group was 77.1 mg/m(2)/week versus 64.7 mg/m(2)/week in the control group (p<0.01). By controlling the development and severity of CIPN, 3S treatment appears to support the use of the recommended nab-PTX dosing for breast cancer patients.

27843610|t|Survey of the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in Japan: Japanese Society of Medical Oncology.
27843610|a|BACKGROUND: Various drugs are administered for the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in Japan. However, there have been no surveys undertaken to identify these drugs or their frequency of prescription. Therefore, we administered a questionnaire survey to the diplomates of the Subspecialty Board of Japanese Society of Medical Oncology (JSMO) to investigate the frequency of administration of different drugs for the management of CIPN in Japan. METHODS: We investigated the use of vitamin B12, antiepileptic agents such as pregabalin, duloxetine, antidepressants other than duloxetine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids and the Kampo compound goshajinkigan in a questionnaire employing a three-step scale wherein A implies routine or prophylactic administration, B implies occasional administration and C implies infrequent administration. RESULTS: Considering responses A and B together, the most frequently administered drugs for the treatment of numbness were antiepileptic drugs such as pregabalin (A+B=98.7%), vitamin B12 (74.7%), Kampo compounds (58.7%) and duloxetine (46.8%). The most frequently prescribed drugs for pain were NSAIDs (97.7%), followed by opioids (83.1%) and finally antiepileptic drugs (82.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Various drugs are frequently administered for CIPN. In addition, it was found that marked differences exist between the drugs targeted on numbness and pain.

15376392|t|[The effect of "huang lian jie du tang" active fraction on experimental cerebral ischemia].
15376392|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of "Huang Lian Jie Du Tang" active fraction (HLJDTAF) on experimental cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats was used to observe the protective effect of HLJDTAF on ischemia stroke. Common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) rat was used to analyse the effect of HLJDTAF on blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Common carotid artery occlusion and reperfusion repeatedly (CCAORR) in mice were used to test effect of HLJDTAF on gasp time, brain exponential and water content of brain. RESULTS: HLJDTAF could improve the abnormal behavior of MCAO rats and decrease the infarction area (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01). HLJDTAF could also significantly prolong the shorten gasp time of CCAORR mice, reduce the brain exponential and decrease the water content in brain (P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: HLJDTAF can protect the brain ischemia injury.

16355450|t|Pharmacokinetics of berberine in rat thalamus after intravenous administration of Coptidis rhizoma extract.
16355450|a|A rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method for determination of berberine in rat thalamus was described in this study. Thalamus samples were pretreated by protein precipitation with methanol and acetonitrile. Berberine was determined using a Hypersil C(18) column with an isocratic mobile phase of acetonitrile--0.05 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate (containing 0.5% triethylamine, pH 3.0) (30:70 v/v) and with UV detection at 265 nm. The lower limit of quantification for berberine in thalamus was 24 ng/ml, and the lowest concentration of berberine determined in rat thalamus samples was 47.5 ng/ml at 48 hours. The calibration curve for berberine was linear (r(2) = 0.9994) over the concentration range 24-6000 ng/ml. At this concentration range, the overall recoveries (91.20%-93.24%) for berberine were determined and the accuracy of the intra- and inter-day assays from rat thalamus were less than 6% RSD. Following intravenous administration of 10.2 mg/kg of Coptidis Rhizoma (CR) extract containing 3 mg/kg berberine into rats, the thalamus level of berberine increased rapidly (t(1/2alpha) = 1.93 hours), peaked at 2.48 hours with a concentration of 271 ng/g, and had a slow elimination rate (t(1/2beta) = 14.6 hours), which suggested that berberine might directly act on certain regions of the thalamus, have pharmacological effects on some cerebral dysfunctions, and be an active ingredient of huang lian jie du tang for the treatment of cerebral disease.

23514232|t|Effect of kai xin san on learning and memory in a rat model of paradoxical sleep deprivation.
23514232|a|The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of kai xin san (KXS, at doses of 500, 250, and 125 mg/kg body weight per day), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, on learning and memory in paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD)-induced cognition deficit rats. Two behavior tests (the Open Field test and the Morris water maze task) were used for testing the effects of KXS on a PSD-induced learning and memory deficit model. Furthermore, its effect on the glutamic acid (GLU) and y-amino-butyric acid (GABA) levels in the brain tissue, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), and phosphorylated-CREB (p-CREB) expression in the hippocampus was also tested. KXS exerted the greatest cognition against the 48 h PSD-induced cognitive deficit and these effects may be mediated by decreasing the GLU and GABA levels and increasing the levels of BDNF, CREB, and p-CREB. This study indicates that the effect of KXS on learning and memory in a rat model of PSD could be associated with the modulation of neurotransmitter levels and the expression of some genes in the brain that contribute to memory functions.

17015952|t|Does a kampo medicine containing schisandra fruit affect pharmacokinetics of nifedipine like grapefruit juice?
17015952|a|Herb-drug interaction has attracted attention as medicinal topics recently. However, the drug information is sometimes confusing. Previous in vitro studies revealed that schisandra fruit had strong inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and claimed the possibilities of its herb-drug interaction. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of schisandra fruit and shoseiryuto, an herbal formula in Japanese traditional kampo medicine containing eight herbal medicines including schisandra fruit, on rat CYP3A activity in vitro, and the effect of shoseiryuto on pharmacokinetics of nifedipine in rats, in comparison with those of grapefruit juice, a well-characterized natural CYP3A inhibitor. Shoseiryuto and its herbal constituents, schisandra fruit, ephedra herb and cinnamon bark exhibited in vitro inhibitory effect of CYP3A. Although shoseiryuto inhibited rat CYP3A activity in vitro with a degree comparable to grapefruit juice, shoseiryuto did not significantly affect a plasma concentration profile of nifedipine in rats as grapefruit juice did. These results indicate that in vivo experiments using the extract of herbal medicine prepared with the same dosage form as patients take are necessary to provide proper information about herb-drug interaction.

19861507|t|Proteomic Analysis of Anti-inflammatory Effects of a Kampo (Japanese Herbal) Medicine "Shoseiryuto (Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang)" on Airway Inflammation in a Mouse Model.
19861507|a|Effects of a Kampo (Japanese herbal) medicine "shoseiryuto (SST, xiao-qing-long-tang in Chinese)", which has been used for the treatment of allergic bronchial asthma clinically, were examined on ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized allergic airway inflammation model (i.e., bronchial asthma) in a mouse. When SST was orally administered at 0.5   g   kg(-1)   day(-1) from day 1 to 6 after OVA inhalation, SST reduced the inflammation in lung tissue, the number of eosinophils and the OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody titer in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids at 7 days after the OVA inhalation. SST also reduced the airway hyperreactivity at 6 days after the OVA inhalation. Proteomic analysis with the agarose two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that the expression of spectrin a2 was reduced in the lung tissue of OVA-sensitized mice and SST recovered the expression. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of lung tissue also confirmed this result. When prednisolone was orally administered at 3   mg   kg(-1)   day(-1) from day 1 to 6 after OVA inhalation, the inflammation in lung tissue, the number of eosinophils in BAL fluids and airway hyperreactivity were reduced in the OVA-sensitized mice. However, prednisolone did not reduce the OVA-specific IgE antibody titer in BAL fluids and did not recover the expression of spectrin a2 in lung tissue. These results suggest that at least a part of action mechanism of SST against OVA-sensitized allergic airway inflammation in a mouse model is different from that of prednisolone.

15684475|t|Anti-inflammatory activity of gumiganghwaltang through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B activation in peritoneal macrophages.
15684475|a|Gumiganghwaltang (GMGHT) is an Oriental herbal prescription, which has been commonly used to treat a cold and inflammatory diseases in Korea. However, the mechanism of GMGHT is not clear. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism of GMGHT in mouse peritoneal macrophages. GMGHT exerted an anti-inflammatory action through inhibiting lipopolysaccaride (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 production in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The maximal inhibition rate of TNF-alpha, and IL-6 production by GMGHT (1 mg/ml) was 52.31+/-2.8% and 56.31+/-3.1%, respectively. In the inflammatory process, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) increased in peritoneal macrophages. GMGHT decreased the protein level of COX-2 and iNOS in LPS-stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages. In addition, GMGHT inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation. Our study suggests that an important molecular mechanism by GMKHT reduce inflammation, which might explain its beneficial effect in the regulation of inflammatory reactions.

21299430|t|A suspected case of somatoform disorder successfully treated with an herbal medicine.
21299430|a|OBJECTIVE: Subjective physical symptoms, irrespective of whether they are psychosomatic or not, do not always show obvious or reasonable signs in examinations, which often makes the differential diagnosis between somatoform disorders and actual physical disease difficult for psychiatrists. In addition, psychiatrists have few clues as to how to treat diverse "medically unexplained" symptoms. This difficulty has highlighted the need for alternative treatments for somatoform disorders. SUBJECT: A 16-year-old high school baseball player was suffering from coxalgia and was unable to walk without crutches over 6 months. No painkiller was effective, the orthopedist found no remarkable signs in any examinations, and the patient was psychiatrically diagnosed with undifferentiated somatoform disorder. However, conventional therapies such as psychotherapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were ineffective. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: The therapeutic strategy was reevaluated from the perspective of Kampo diagnostics and keishikajutsubuto, a traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine, was chosen to be prescribed, which had a remarkable effect. His leg function improved within 2 weeks, and his pain and need for crutches disappeared in 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Keishikajutsubuto has a different pain-relieving effect from conventional therapies. Kampo medicine thus provides an alternative approach for treating medically unexplained symptoms without strictly distinguishing between physically existing illness and psychologically caused somatoform disorders. Although details regarding the therapeutic mechanisms of Kampo medicine remain unclear and further studies are needed to increase its usefulness in clinical practice, Kampo medicine should be considered as an alternative treatment, especially for somatoform disorders.

21423692|t|Effect of Hachimijiogan against Renal Dysfunction and Involvement of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1a in the Remnant Kidney Model.
21423692|a|In chronic renal failure, hypoxia of renal tissue is thought to be the common final pathway leading to end-stage renal failure. In this study the effects of hachimijiogan, a Kampo formula, were studied with respect to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Using remnant kidney rats, we studied the effects of hachimijiogan on renal function in comparison with angiotensin II receptor blocker. The result showed that oral administration of hachimijiogan for seven days suppressed urinary protein excretion and urinary 8-OHdG, a marker of antioxidant activity, equally as well as oral administration of candesartan cilexetil. In contrast, the protein volume of HIF-1a in the renal cortex was not increased in the candesartan cilexetil group, but that in the hachimijiogan group was increased. In immunohistochemical studies as well, the expression of HIF-1a of the high-dose hachimijiogan group increased compared to that of the control group. Vascular endothelial growth factor and glucose transporter 1, target genes of HIF-1a, were also increased in the hachimijiogan group. These results suggest that hachimijiogan produces a protective effect by a mechanism different from that of candesartan cilexetil.

18227914|t|Two kampo medicines, jidabokuippo and hachimijiogan alleviate sprains, bruises and arthritis.
18227914|a|In traditional Chinese medicine theory (TCM), the affected parts of sprains, bruises and arthritis are considered to be under certain conditions of TCM concept. We administered two Kampo medicines with synergistic effects to promote quick recovery from these conditions. Jidabokuippo (Zhidapuyifang in Chinese), which means 'decoction for contusions' is expected to remove these conditions. Hachimijiogan (Baweidihuangwan in Chinese), which translates as 'eight-ingredient pill with Rehmannia' is expected to restore presumed minute bone injury and regulates bone metabolism by changing such conditions based on TCM theory. We administered the two prescriptions to 10 patients (age range: 40-85 years; 1 male, 9 females) suffering from bruises, sprains, arthritis and spinal compression fracture without changing their routine intake of other drugs. Patients reported on changes in the pain of affected body parts by using the visual analog scale (VAS) before and after administration of Kampo medicine. In almost all cases, recovery began promptly after administration and the pain disappeared within approximately 2 weeks. Large doses for a short time brought about much quicker recovery than small doses. Administration of a combination of two Kampo medicines, Jidabokuippo and Hachimijiogan, quickly resolved the pain of bruises, sprains, arthritis and one spinal compression fracture.

1816726|a|A hyperprolactinemic infertile woman with a pituitary microadenoma, who was resistant to bromocriptine as a method of bringing on pregnancy, succeeded in having a normal pregnancy and delivery with Hachimi-jio-gan treatment. This paper reports that the patient did not succeed in pregnancy in spite of 16 months of bromocriptine treatment, though her prolactin level gradually decreased and continued to be between 40-60 ng/ml with Hachimi-jio-gan treatment. Although the level of prolactin of the patient did not normalize, she, nevertheless, succeeded in having a normal pregnancy and delivery.

7841938|t|Effect of hachimijiogan, an oriental herbal medicinal mixture, on experimental amnesia in mice.
7841938|a|The effect of Hachimijiogan on cognitive disturbance was investigated using step-through passive avoidance failure techniques: scopolamine-, cycloheximide- and cerebral ischemia-induced amnesia. Pre-acquisition trial administration of Hachimijiogan (0.5 g/kg, p.o.) prolonged the step-through latency reduced by scopolamine and cycloheximide. Hachimijiogan (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg, p.o.) also ameliorated the cerebral ischemia-induced amnesia. Physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated all three amnesia models. The ameliorating effects of Hachimijiogan and physostigmine on cycloheximide-induced amnesia were diminished by the combination with scopolamine. These results suggest that Hachimijiogan possesses a wide-ranging pharmacological profile in anti-amnesic actions and that its anti-amnesic activities may be related to the cholinergic neuronal system.

1767793|t|Effects of hachimijiogan on dopamine, serotonin and vasoactive intestinal peptide in plasma and hypothalamus in sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic rats.
1767793|a|Effect of Hachimijiogan (HJ) on dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was examined in plasma and hypothalamic tissue of sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic rats (SHR). Similar to bromocriptine (BR), HJ, in combination with sulpiride, suppressed plasma prolactin levels raised by sulpiride alone. Furthermore, HJ, together with sulpiride, increased plasma DA levels decreased by sulpiride alone, while 5-HT in plasma was increased by sulpiride and HJ, individually or in combination. However, plasma VIP levels were under detection limits on some occasions after HJ treatment. Successively, DA, 5-HT and VIP levels in the hypothalamus were determined. Similar to the effect caused by BR, DA and 5-HT levels in hypothalamic tissue reduced by sulpiride alone were also significantly increased by HJ together with sulpiride, while VIP levels were sometimes under detection levels with or without HJ. These results suggest that HJ stimulates the hypothalamus to increase DA and 5-HT in SHR, providing evidence for the clinical efficiency of HJ in combating hyperprolactinemia. The effect of HJ on VIP in plasma or hypothalamic tissue is, however, questionable.

Ten percent of these patients showed remarkable improvement in their volume of semen, 10% showed improvement and 80.0% showed no improvement. Thirty percent of these patients showed remarkable improvement in the number of sperm, 10.0% showed improvement, and 60.0% showed no improvement. Twenty percent of these patients showed remarkable improvement in their sperm mobility, 30.0% showed improvement and 50.0% showed no improvement. The fertility index was improved markedly in 60.0%, improved in 20.0% and not improved in 20.0%. The spouses of 2 patients became pregnant. Side effects were seen in only 30.0% (epigastralgia) of these patients. Laboratory examination of these patients revealed no significant change. These results suggested that concomitant administration of Ninjinto and Hachimijiogan is effective on patients with male infertility.

4025217|a|Ba-wei-wan was administered for 7 months to 24 aged, non-hospitalized subjects. Laboratory examinations showed an improvement in serum or plasma levels of total lipid, LPO and HDL-C. Other blood examinations were shown to be unaffected by the treatment. To reconfirm the effects of Ba-wei-wan on lipid metabolism, the three step administration of the drug was employed. The elevation of HDL-C levels and the decrease of LPO levels were obtained by this treatment. The discontinuation of this drug induced the converse effect on the plasma levels; decreased HDL-C and increased LPO. It could be concluded from these results that Ba-wei-wan administration improved the lipid metabolism in the aged subjects.

26937322|t|Post-gastrectomy Syndrome Successfully Treated With Kampo Medicine: A Case Report.
26937322|a|Cancer-related gastrectomy can cause post-gastrectomy syndrome, which includes weight loss, dumping syndrome, and reflux esophagitis and negatively affects the quality of life. Comprehensive and individualized patient management is required; however, there is a limit to Western medicine's ability to treat these symptoms. Kampo, a traditional Japanese medicine, adapts treatments to each individual's symptoms and constitution. We treated a 68-year-old male patient with post-gastrectomy syndrome using senpukukataishasekito, a Kampo medicine. He was diagnosed with Stage II-A gastric cancer at age 66 years and underwent a laparoscopic, pylorus-preserving gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy for 13 months. He visited our clinic for chemotherapy-related fatigue, postsurgical weight loss, and limb numbness. He was prescribed both hachimijiogan and hochuekkito. At the second visit, he complained of stomach discomfort, so we prescribed senpukukataishasekito. As his stomach function improved, his body weight increased and his fatigue decreased. We suggest that senpukukataishasekito may be an effective treatment for post-gastrectomy syndrome.

20858178|t|The efficacy and safety of herbal medicines used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia; a systematic review.
20858178|a|OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on the efficacy and safety of effective herbal medicines in the management of hyperlipidemia in human. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and IranMedex databases were searched up to 11th May 2010. The search terms were "hyperlipidemia" and ("herbal medicine" or "medicine traditional", "extract plant") without narrowing or limiting search elements. All of the human studies on the effects of herbs with the key outcome of change in lipid profiles were included. RESULTS: Fifty three relevant clinical trials were reviewed for efficacy of plants. This study showed significant decrease in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol after treatment with Daming capsule (DMC), chunghyul-dan, Glycyrrhiza glabra, garlic powder (Allicor), black tea, green tea, soy drink enriched with plant sterols, licorice, Satureja khuzestanica, Monascus purpureus Went rice, Fenugreek, Commiphora mukul (guggul), Achillea wilhelmsii C. Koch, Ningzhi capsule (NZC), cherry, compositie salviae dropping pill (CSDP), shanzha xiaozhi capsule, Ba-wei-wan (hachimijiogan), rhubarb stalk, Silybum marianum, Rheum Ribes and Jingmingdan granule (primrose oil). Conflicting data exist for red yeast rice, garlic and guggul. No significant adverse effect or mortality were observed except in studies with DMC, guggul, and Terminalia belerica, Terminalia chebula, Emblica officinalis, ginger, and garlic powder (Allium sativum). CONCLUSION: Amongst reviewed studies, 22 natural products were found effective in the treatment of hyperlipidemia that deserve further works to isolate and characterization of their constituents to reach novel therapeutic and more effective agents.

20346181|t|Bojungikgitang and banhabaekchulchonmatang in adult patients with tinnitus, a randomized, double-blind, three-arm, placebo-controlled trial--study protocol.
20346181|a|BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is the perception of hearing a sound for which there is no external acoustic source. It is often associated with sudden, temporary hearing loss and has a clear impact on a patient's quality of life. Despite numerous trials, there are no treatments that can be considered well established in terms of providing replicable long-term tinnitus reduction. Complementary and alternative medical approaches have been employed to relieve symptoms of tinnitus. Bojungikgitang and banhabaekchulchonmatang are among the most strongly preferred and widely used herbal medicines for tinnitus in Korea, as they cause very few serious adverse effects.We aim to establish basic clinical efficacy and safety data for bojungikgitang and banhabaekchulchonmatang, which are approved as herbal medications by the Korea Food and Drug Administration in adult patients with tinnitus. METHODS/DESIGN: This study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with three parallel arms (bojungikgitang, banhabaekchulchonmatang, and a placebo). Participants included in the study met the following criteria: typical conditions of intermittent or continuous tinnitus, for more than three months, with involuntary perceptions of the concept of a sound in the absence of an external source. Participants received bojungikgitang, banhabaekchulchonmatang, or a placebo-drug for eight weeks. The total duration of each arm was eleven weeks. Each participant was examined for signs and symptoms of tinnitus before and after taking medication. Post-treatment follow-up was performed two weeks after the final administration of medication. DISCUSSION: This trial provided evidence for the efficacy and safety of bojungikgitang and banhabaekchulchonmatang in adult patients with tinnitus. The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, an assessment used to identify difficulties that may be experienced due to tinnitus. The secondary measures were included an Acoustic Examination and the Visual Analogue Scale. We employed the Euro-Qol 5-Dimension and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3, a health-related quality of life questionnaire. Safety was assessed by complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood chemistry, urine analysis, PA chest film, brain computed tomography, otologic examination, and vital signs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN23691284.

24790634|t|Treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder using the traditional Japanese herbal medicine saikokeishikankyoto: a randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial in survivors of the great East Japan earthquake and tsunami.
24790634|a|The Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami caused immense damage over a wide area of eastern Japan. Hence, many survivors are at high risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial examined the efficacy and safety of the traditional Japanese herbal formula saikokeishikankyoto (SKK) in the treatment of PTSD among survivors of this disaster. Forty-three participants with an Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score >=  25 were randomized into SKK (n = 21) and control (n = 22) groups. The primary endpoint was the change in IES-R scores from baseline till after 2 weeks of treatment. Intergroup statistical comparisons were performed. The magnitude of changes in total IES-R scores differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed that the total IES-R score improved significantly in the SKK group from 49.6    11.9 to 25.5    17.0 (P < 0.001). Subscale scores improved significantly in the SKK group (avoidance, P = 0.003; hyperarousal, P < 0.001; intrusion, P < 0.001). Two-week treatment with SKK significantly improved IES-R scores among PTSD patients. This traditional medicine may be a valid choice for the treatment of psychological and physical symptoms in PTSD patients.

15143761|t|[Examination of the Tanyin chapter of the "Heji Jufang"].
15143761|a|An examination of the tanyin chapter of the "Heji Jufang", the world's first national pharmacopoeia and the major pharmacopoeia of the Northern Sung era, yielded the following findings:(1) In the tanyin chapter, we identified many examples of discussions based on the theory of "lung and stomach disorders". Since this theoryis not found in medical books before the Tang era, and since many examples can be found in the "Heji Jufang" and other medical books of the same period, we believe this is a view of pathology peculiar to the Northern Sung era.(2) A comparison of the components of prescriptions used in the "Waitai Miyaofang" and the tanyin chapter of the "Heji Jufang" revealed that the former contains many strong diuretics, purgatives, and crude drugs of a hot nature, while the later contains few of these but many diuretics that have a mild antitussive effect. We believe the use of medicines in the latter is related to the treatment of "avoiding diuretics and purgatives which could adversely affect pi qi."(3) We pointed out that the er chen tang in the tanyin chapter of the "Heji Jufang" is merely one prescription of a group of prescriptions to treat a morbid condition caused by the disorders of the stagnant tanyin. We revealed in the "Yijianfang" and "Wangbing Huichun" the process by which, with the passage of time, that er chen tang came to be widely interpreted as the basic prescription for tanyin, including chronic cases.

24348193|t|Pharmacological effects of active compounds on neurodegenerative disease with gastrodia and uncaria decoction, a commonly used poststroke decoction.
24348193|a|Neurodegenerative diseases refer to the selective loss of neuronal systems in patients. The diseases cause high morbidity and mortality to approximately 22 million people worldwide and the number is expected to be tripled by 2050. Up to now, there is no effective prevention and treatment for the neurodegenerative diseases. Although some of the clinical therapies target at slowing down the progression of symptoms of the diseases, the general effectiveness of the drugs has been far from satisfactory. Traditional Chinese medicine becomes popular alternative remedies as it has been practiced clinically for more than thousands of years in China. As neurodegenerative diseases are mediated through different pathways, herbal decoction with multiple herbs is used as an effective therapeutic approach to work on multiple targets. Gastrodia and Uncaria Decoction, a popular TCM decoction, has been used to treat stroke in China. The decoction contains compounds including alkaloids, flavonoids, iridoids, carotenoids, and natural phenols, which have been found to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiapoptotic effects. In this review, we will summarize the recent publications of the pharmacological effects of these five groups of compounds. Understanding the mechanisms of action of these compounds may provide new treatment opportunities for the patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

27143961|a|Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic skin disease characterized by sterile intraepidermal pustules associated with erythematous scaling on the palms and soles. Jumihaidokuto is a traditional herbal medicine composed of ten medical plants and has been given to patients with suppurative skin disease in Japan. This study investigated the effect of jumihaidokuto on the disease activity in PPP patients (n = 10). PPP patients were given jumihaidokuto (EKT-6; 6.0   g per day) for 4 to 8 weeks in addition to their prescribed medications. The results showed that the palmoplantar pustular psoriasis area and severity index (PPPASI) was decreased after the administration of jumihaidokuto (p < 0.05). Therefore, Jumihaidokuto is seemingly effective against PPP.

26495013|t|Suppression of Propionibacterium acnes-Induced Dermatitis by a Traditional Japanese Medicine, Jumihaidokuto, Modifying Macrophage Functions.
26495013|a|Purpose. Macrophages serve as sweepers of microbes and inflammation-derived wastes and regulators of inflammation. Some traditional Japanese medicines are reported to have adjuvant effects by modifying macrophages. Our aim was to characterize the actions of jumihaidokuto (JHT) for treatment of skin inflammations including acne vulgaris, in which Propionibacterium acnes has pathogenic roles. Methods. Dermatitis was induced in rat ears by intradermal injection of P. acnes. JHT or prednisolone (PDN) was given orally, and ear thickness and histology were evaluated. The effects of constituents and metabolites of JHT on monocytes were tested by cell-based assays using the human monocytic THP-1 cell. Results. JHT and PDN suppressed the ear thickness induced by P. acnes injection. Histological examinations revealed that JHT, but not PDN, promoted macrophage accumulation at 24   h after the injection. PDN suppressed the macrophage chemokine MCP-1 in the inflamed ears, while JHT did not affect it. The JHT constituents liquiritigenin and isoliquiritin increased expression of CD86 (type-1 macrophage marker) and CD192 (MCP-1 receptor) and enhanced phagocytosis by THP-1. Conclusions. JHT suppressed dermatitis, probably by enhancing type-1 macrophage functions, with an action different from PDN. JHT may be a beneficial drug in treatment of skin inflammation induced by P. acnes.

25709710|t|Inhibition of Rat 5a-Reductase Activity and Testosterone-Induced Sebum Synthesis in Hamster Sebocytes by an Extract of Quercus acutissima Cortex.
25709710|a|Objective. Bokusoku (BK) is an extract from the Quercus cortex used in folk medicine for treatment of skin disorders and convergence, and is present in jumihaidokuto, a traditional Japanese medicine that is prescribed for purulent skin diseases like acne vulgaris. The excess of sebum production induced by androgen is involved in the development of acne. Our aim is to examine whether BK and its constituents inhibit testosterone metabolism and testosterone-induced sebum synthesis. Methods. Measurements of 5a-reductase activity and lipogenesis were performed using rat liver microsomes and hamster sebocytes, respectively. Results. BK dose-dependently reduced the conversion of testosterone to a more active androgen, dihydrotestosterone in a 5a-reductase enzymatic reaction. Twenty polyphenols in BK categorized as gallotannin, ellagitannin, and flavonoid were identified by LC-MS/MS. Nine polyphenols with gallate group, tetragalloyl glucose, pentagalloyl glucose, eugeniin, 1-desgalloyl eugeniin, casuarinin, castalagin, stenophyllanin C, (-)-epicatechin gallate, and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, inhibited testosterone metabolism. In particular, pentagalloyl glucose showed the strongest activity. BK and pentagalloyl glucose suppressed testosterone-induced lipogenesis, whereas they weakly inhibited the lipogenic action of insulin. Conclusions. BK inhibited androgen-related pathogenesis of acne, testosterone conversion, and sebum synthesis, partially through 5a-reductase inhibition, and has potential to be a useful agent in the therapeutic strategy of acne.

23326296|t|Hochuekkito (TJ-41), a Kampo Formula, Ameliorates Cachexia Induced by Colon 26 Adenocarcinoma in Mice.
23326296|a|Cachexia, a major cause of cancer-related death, is characterized by depletion of muscle and fat tissues, anorexia, asthenia, and hypoglycemia. Recent studies indicate that secretions of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) play a crucial role in cachexia development, and that these cytokines are secreted from not only cancer cells but also host cells such as macrophages. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of hochuekkito, a Kampo formula, on cachexia induced by colon 26 adenocarcinoma in mice. Hochuekkito treatment did not inhibit tumor growth, but significantly attenuated the reduction in carcass weight, food and water intake, weight of the gastrocnemius muscle and fat tissue around the testes, and decrease of serum triglyceride level compared with controls. Furthermore, hochuekkito treatment significantly reduced serum IL-6 level and IL-6 expression level in macrophages in tissues surrounding the tumor. In vitro studies showed that hochuekkito suppressed the production of IL-6 by THP-1 or RAW264.7 macrophage cells, although it did not affect IL-6 production by colon 26 carcinoma cells. These results suggest that hochuekkito inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, by host cells such as macrophages. Therefore, hochuekkito may be a promising anticachectic agent for the treatment of patients with cancer.

9739585|t|[Direct effects of Chinese herbal medicine "hochuekkito" on sperm movement].
9739585|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chinese herbal medicine, "Hochuekkito" is widely used for male infertility in Japan. There have been many reports concerning its clinical usefulness but very few reports of in vitro experiments studying the mechanism of its effects. In addition to stimulating germ cells, we analyzed its direct effects on sperm using computer assisted semen analyzer (CASA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Motile sperm were prepared using swim up technique from semen collected from ten healthy volunteers. Sperm movements (motility, velocity, linearity) were analyzed by CASA after adding either serum containing anti-sperm antibody (ASA) or normal serum with or without Hochuekkito. RESULTS: Two hours after adding serum with ASA, the decrease of sperm motility was significantly reduced from 25.1% (92.8%-->67.7%) to 12.5% (92.9%-->80.6%) by adding Hochuekkito. No significant difference in velocity and linearity was observed between two groups. By adding normal serum, any of three parameters differed significantly with or without Hochuekkito. CONCLUSION: Protective effects of Hochuekkito on sperm was suggested. Although normal sperm with ASA was used in this report, since the sperm of infertile patients are said to be more fragile, this results imply that direct protective effect is one of the mechanism of Hochuekkito for male infertility.

17173109|t|Stimulating effect of Japanese herbal (kampo) medicine, hochuekkito on upper respiratory mucosal immune system.
17173109|a|Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine, Hochuekkito (Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang in Chinese, TJ-41) and Juzentaihoto (Shi-Quan-Da-Bu-Tang in Chinese, TJ-48) are well-known Kampo formulas used as tonic. Although these medicines have separately been applied to the patients clinically depending on their symptoms, the differences of the pharmacological activities for these medicines have not been fully understood. TJ-48 and TJ-41 were compared for their effects on antibody response in upper respiratory mucosal immune system in vivo. Oral administration of TJ-41 (100 mg kg(-1) per day) to early aged BALB/c mice, which were nasally sensitized with influenza hemagglutinin vaccine, significantly enhanced influenza virus-specific IgA and IgG antibody titers in nasal cavity and sera, respectively. However, oral administration of TJ-48 (100 mg kg(-1) per day) failed to show the enhancing activity. TJ-41 increased not only influenza virus-specific IgA antibody titer but also total IgA antibody titer in nasal cavity. The stimulating activity of TJ-41 disappeared after treatment with methotrexate. The present study strongly suggests that TJ-41 can stimulate the mucosal immune system of upper respiratory tract, and results in enhancement of antigen-specific antibody response in upper respiratory mucosal and systemic immune systems.

1519556|a|To investigate the changes in responsiveness to hCG stimulation, and the effects on sperm qualities and basal hormone levels, 63 infertile men received 7.5qr of Hochuekkito daily for 3 months (1). Sperm density (p less than 0.01) and motility (p less than 0.01) were significantly increased after the treatment (2). Serum prolactin (p less than 0.01) and estradiol (p less than 0.01) levels were significantly decreased after the treatment (3). Enhanced responsiveness of testosterone (p less than 0.05) and estradiol (p less than 0.05) excretion to hCG injection were observed in patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. These results suggested that Hochuekkito corrected Leydig cell dysfunctions in some infertile men, resulting in improvements in sperm qualities.

23294358|t|Protective effect of hochuekkito, a Kampo prescription, against ultraviolet B irradiation-induced skin damage in hairless mice.
23294358|a|A Kampo prescriptions, hochuekkito (HET) has been utilized for treating functional conditions such as general fatigue, compromised state and gastrointestinal motility disorder. Recently, HET has attracted the attention of dermatologists because of its clinically positive effects in atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment. To explain this positive effect of HET, we examined its protective ability against oxidative skin stress using a murine model. The dorsal region of 8-week-old male HR-1 hairless mice, which were raised on a HET (0%, 2% and 10%) mixed diet, was irradiated once with 70  mJ/cm(2) of ultraviolet (UV)-B light. After 4  days, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum water content (SCWC), were determined as a measure of degree of skin dysfunction. To estimate the amount of active oxygen generated, the stratum corneum catalase activity (SCCA) and stratum corneum carbonylated protein (SCCP) content in the tape-stripped stratum corneum samples were measured. We also measured the H(2) O(2) scavenging ability of HET, and analyzed the changes in the expression levels of several inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes in the skin of HET-fed mice. In control mice, exposure to UV-B led to significant increases in TEWL and SCCP and significant decreases in SCWC and SCCA. These UV-B-induced changes were reduced in mice administrated HET, and the reduction was HET dose-dependent. Our results suggested that HET offered a protective effect against UV-B-induced skin damage. We also found that HET had relatively low ability to scavenge H(2) O(2) , and expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA decreased in HET-fed mouse.

26809298|t|[Kampo Therapy for Patients with Cancer - The Role of Kampo Medicine in Team Therapy].
26809298|a|This study details the role of Kampo medicine in cancer therapy. Cancer normally cannot be cured only with Kampo medicine. Therefore, Kampo should be administered in combination with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. In that context, Kampo is useful in team therapy for patients with cancer. One of the characteristics of Kampo medicine is that Kampo diagnosis does not target the disease, but the patient with the disease. Kampo diagnosis is called"pattern diagnosis". Many patients with cancer are diagnosed with a"deficiency pattern","cold pattern","qi deficiency pattern", or"blood deficiency pattern". Based on these diagnoses, hochuekkito or juzentaihoto are often used for patients with cancer. Many other Kampo formulae can be used for patients with cancer diagnosed with the"qi deficiency pattern"and/or"blood deficiency pattern". Kampo is not only considered an herbal therapy, but also acupuncture/moxibustion and Yojo(nourishing life). To implement these Kampo modalities comprehensively, team therapy is essential. In order to treat a patient with cancer, rather than the cancer itself, Kampo can be used effectively.

2561156|t|A Chinese traditional medicine, juzentaihoto, inhibits the O2- generation by macrophages.
2561156|a|Guinea pig peritoneal macrophages generate superoxide anion (O2-), when stimulated with N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP), phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA) or ovalbumin complex of guinea pig IgG2 antibody (OA gamma 2). These responses were found to be inhibited by a Chinese traditional medicine, Juzentaihoto (JT). When the inhibition was assayed by the use of fMLP as a stimulant, at least one of the substances responsible for the inhibitory activity of JT was identified to be cinnamic acid. An authentic sample of cinnamic acid also inhibited the O2- generation by fMLP-stimulated macrophages. Cinnamic acid, however, did not inhibit the O2- generation, when macrophages were stimulated with PMA and OA gamma 2. These results indicate that a certain cinnamic acid-inhibitable factor may be involved in the intracellular triggering event(s) initiated by fMLP, leading to activation of the respiratory burst reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, but not in those by PMA and OA gamma 2.

24348705|t|The long-term effects of a kampo medicine, juzentaihoto, on maintenance of antibody titer in elderly people after influenza vaccination.
24348705|a|We have performed a broad-ranging analysis of the adjuvant effect of a Kampo medicine, juzentaihoto (JTT), on influenza vaccination in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. In this study, the enhancing effect of JTT on antibody titer after influenza vaccination was studied for 28 weeks in elderly people who were in the high-risk group for influenza infection. In total, 91 subjects over 65 years old were recruited from four long-term-care facilities located in Chiba, Gunma, and Toyama prefectures in Japan. Participants were randomly assigned to the JTT and the control groups. Blood samples were taken at 4 weeks before vaccination, at the time of vaccination, and then at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after vaccination. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 were then manually measured. A significant increase in HI titer against H3N2 was observed at week 8 after vaccination in the JTT group compared with the control group (P = 0.0229), and the HI titer of the JTT group significantly increased from 4 to 24 weeks (P = 0.0468), compared with the control group. In conclusion, our results indicated that JTT increased and prolonged antibody production against A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2), in particular, after influenza vaccination.

6425487|t|Protective effects of juzentaihoto, dried decoctum of 10 Chinese herbs mixture, upon the adverse effects of mitomycin C in mice.
6425487|a|In view of the reduction of side effects as well as the enhancement of anti-tumor activities of anticancer drugs, we have been interested in the combined use of Chinese medicines with them. In the present study, we attempted to examine the effects of Chinese prescription, juzentaihoto (JTX), combined with mitomycin C (MMC). JTX is consisted of Astragali radix, Chinnamomi cortex, Rehmanniae radix, Paeonia radix, Cnidii rhizoma, Atractylodis lanceae rhizoma, Angelicae radix, Ginseng radix, Hoelen and Glycyrrhizae radix. In BDF1-mice which were implanted with P-388 leukemic cells, JTX prolonged significantly the average survival days of MMC-treated group. In tumor-free BDF1-mice, JTX improved the leukopenia and the body weight loss which were caused by MMC. Additionally, JTX delayed the appearance of deaths by lethal dosis of MMC. These results indicate that JTX enhances the anti-tumor activity of MMC and lessens the adverse effects of it. JTX may be useful for patients undertaking MMC treatment.

22070441|t|A case of aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole)-induced side-effects successfully treated with Kampo medicines.
22070441|a|OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer is the fourth most frequent cause of death, and it is currently the most frequent cause of death among Japanese women. As to breast cancer therapy, lengthy hormonal therapy is very important for the treatment and prevention of recurrence. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the initial drug of choice for postoperative adjuvant therapy of breast cancer in Japan. AIs require long-term use and occasionally cause serious side-effects. In this report, the effects of Kampo medicines (Japanese traditional medicines) on AIs-induced side-effects are described. SUBJECT: A 55-year-old woman visited the Kampo outpatient department of Chiba University Hospital for atypical genital bleeding and arthralgia. At the age of 54, she suffered from left breast cancer and underwent left total mastectomy followed by chemotherapy for 6 months. Afterwards, 1 mg/day of anastrozole, one of the AIs, was used for therapy. Three (3) months later, atypical genital bleeding from vaginal mucosa and joint pains of bilateral hands and knees occurred as side-effects of anastrozole. Her attending doctor could only prescribe nonsteroidal external medicine for the inflammation of vaginal mucosa and do close follow-up. However, her symptoms showed no improvement. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME: Her deficiency of both ki (qi) and ketsu (Blood) was diagnosed based on Kampo diagnostics. Juzentaihoto was used for treatment. After taking juzentaihoto for 5 weeks, the atypical genital bleeding disappeared, and she no longer need topical medicine. Because her arthralgia showed no improvement, powdered processed aconitine root was added. After taking 3.0 g/day of this medication, her arthralgia almost completely disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Controlling the side-effects is a clinical issue from the viewpoint of adherence to drug treatment. Kampo therapy should be considered one of the choices for side-effects in the process of cancer treatment.

23997796|t|Role of Kampo medicine in integrative cancer therapy.
23997796|a|Clinical trials to date demonstrate that standard cancer treatments are currently the most efficient treatments for large numbers of cancer patients. Cancer treatments will increasingly require approaches that allow patients to live with cancer, by increasing their natural healing power and tumor immunity, as well as attenuating the progression of their cancers, instead of only attacking the cancer cells directly. Complementary and alternative medicine, including Kampo medicine, compensates for the drawbacks of western medicine by increasing patients' self-defense mechanisms. In Japan, clinicians who have studied both western medicine and Kampo treat cancer patients by fusing the two medical systems into a unitary one. The goal of the system is to assist the functional maintenance and recovery of the living body complex with the physical, mental, social, and spiritual balance, rather than addressing direct antitumor effects. In this review, we describe the usefulness of Kampo medicine, especially juzentaihoto, and outline the reports on evidence, in addition to the report on an attitudinal survey about the use of Kampo medicine in cancer treatment in Japan.

15555225|a|As a medical book of the Song dynasty, there are marks of "re-collating and checking" at the head of each subject at each volume in Ji feng pu ji fang (Jifeng's Formularies for Universal Relief), thus, the book was mistakenly attributed to Zhang Rui. Based on the time characteristics, case records, medical affairs, avoidance of emperor's name, and the original draft, it should be written during the Yuanfeng reign and published during the Gaozong emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. By carefully analyzing the medical lives of Sun Zhao, who died at the end of Yuanfeng reign, Sun Zhao should be its real author, whereas Zhang Rui, who was still alive in the Shaoxing reign of the Southern Song dynasty, was not its author. The research into the medical affairs and birth date of Chu Yushi and Dong Ji's Jiao qi zhi fa zong yao (Essential for Treating Beriberi) provides a powerful evidence for this conclusion.

4061223|a|To study its clinical effect, Tsumura Seishinrenshiin, was administered to male patients of chronic prostatitis and urethritis with various equivocal complaints of the lower urinary tract and female patients complaining of cystitoid symptoms inspite of normal urine. These subjects were 35 males, 20 to 69 years and 7 females 22 to 78 years. For the patients who had constitutionally infirm stomach and intestines the rate of effectiveness reached 41%, which was rather satisfactory. For the other patients, however, it was only 28%. Besides no correlation was observed between the age of patient and the effectiveness. A combined administration of antibiotics and antibacterial agents led to no increase in the effectiveness. All of the side effects were rather slight, which permitted its continuous administration over a period of more than 4 weeks. From the above findings Seishinrenshiin was expected to be both effective for the patients who have constitutionally infirm stomach and intestines and can be used safely.

27748836|a|UNASSIGNED: Alternative medicine is a widely accepted therapeutic approach for the management of various diseases. The Korean medicine, musulju (MSJ), has been traditionally used to improve vital energy in men with reduced physical strength and a weakened urinary system. The present study determined the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of MSJ against benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common disorder in elderly men that involves inflammation  -mediated imbalance between cell proliferation and death. MSJ treatment was demonstrated to decrease prostate weight, cell proliferation, and the protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in a rat model of BPH. In addition, MSJ markedly reduced serum testosterone levels, 5a  -reductase2 mRNA expression and BPH  -associated upregulation of inflammatory proteins, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase  2. Furthermore, MSJ induced apoptosis by regulating B  -cell lymphoma (Bcl)  -2  protein expression and the Bcl  -2:Bax ratio, leading to caspase  3  activation. Taken together, MSJ demonstrated antiproliferative effects in BPH model rats by regulating the expression levels of proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis. The effects of MSJ may be attributed to its alternative therapeutic properties.

1498532|a|The purpose of the present study is to evaluate clinical effect of the integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine in the treatment of periodontal disease. 90 patients suffered from mild to advanced periodontitis were divided into two groups. The gu chi wan (tooth firming pills) group was administered tooth firming pills 4 mg twice daily for 3-6 months combined with spiramycin 0.2 four times daily for 5 days and routine periodontal treatment. The spiramycin group, as control, was administered spiramycin 0.2 four times daily for 5 days combined with routine periodontal treatment. The clinical parameters: GI, PLI, PDI and serial radiographs were checked on the beginning of study and through 3, 6, 12, 24 months follow up study. The results showed that the GI and PDI of the gu chi wan group decreased significantly than the control group (P less than 0.001). The inflammatory recurrence rate was 33% in the control group and 12% in gu chi wan group and the serial radiographs demonstrated that a higher incidence of bone fill occurred in gu chi wan group than in the control group (P less than 0.01).

16778362|a|To evaluate the efficacy of three common antitussive Kampo formulas, eppikahangeto (EPP), bakumondoto (BAK), and shoseiryutogomakyokansekito (SGM), a new cough model of guinea pig was used, which could specifically induce a laryngeal cough by microinjection of citric acid solution into the larynx. Kampo extract was dissolved in water and the animals were given access ad libitum for 3 days, and then the number of coughs during 10 min was counted. EPP extract decreased the number of coughs dose-dependently (0.3% extract, -22.9 +/- 6.6%, P<0.01; 1.0% extract, -32.4 +/- 5.5%, P<0.01). BAK extract and SGM extract had no significant effect. Intraperitoneal injection of codeine (60 mg/kg) also decreased the number of coughs (-36.1 +/- 9.1%, P<0.05). Furthermore, Ephedrae herba (EH) extract reduced the number of coughs (-18.3 +/- 6.0%, P<0.05), but the extract of EPP without EH did not. These results suggest that EPP has an antitussive effect against laryngeally-induced cough in guinea pigs, and the crucial herbal medicine is EH.

23258998|t|Chinese patent medicine liu wei di huang wan combined with antihypertensive drugs, a new integrative medicine therapy, for the treatment of essential hypertension: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
23258998|a|Objectives. To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (LWDHW), combined with antihypertensive drugs, for essential hypertension. Methods. Five major electronic databases were searched up to August 2012 to retrieve any potential randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs for essential hypertension reported in any language, with main outcome measures as blood pressure. The quality of the included studies was assessed with the Jadad scale and a customized standard quality assessment scale. Results. 6 randomized trials were included. The methodological quality of the trials was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs was more effective in blood pressure and the scale for TCM syndrome and symptom differentiation scores compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. Most of the trials did not report adverse events, and the safety is still uncertain. Conclusions. LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs appears to be effective in improving blood pressure and symptoms in patients with essential hypertension. However, the evidence remains weak due to the poor methodological quality of the included studies.

24778699|t|Alleviative Effects of a Kampo (a Japanese Herbal) Medicine "Maoto (Ma-Huang-Tang)" on the Early Phase of Influenza Virus Infection and Its Possible Mode of Action.
24778699|a|A Kampo medicine, maoto, has been prescribed in an early phase of influenza-like illness and used for a treatment of influenza clinically in Japan these days. However, the efficacy of maoto against the virus infection remains to be elucidated. This study was conducted to evaluate the alleviative effects of maoto against early phase of influenza virus infection and its preliminary mode of actions through immune systems. When maoto (0.9 and 1.6   g/kg/day) was orally administered to A/J mice on upper respiratory tract infection of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 from 4   hours to 52   hours postinfection (p.i.) significant antipyretic effect was shown in comparison with water-treated control. Administration of maoto (0.8 and 1.3   g/kg/day) significantly decreased the virus titers in both nasal (NLF) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) at 52 hours p.i., and significantly increased the anti-influenza virus IgM, IgA, and IgG1 antibody titers in NLF, BALF, and serum, respectively. Maoto also increased significantly the influenza virus-bound IgG1 and IgM antibody titers in serum and the virus-bound IgM antibody titer in even the BALF of uninfected A/J mice. These results indicate that maoto exerts antipyretic activity in influenza virus-infected mice and virus reducing effect at an early phase of the infection through probably augmentation of the virus-bound natural antibodies.

19483419|t|[Pharmaceutical analysis and clinical efficacy of Kampo medicine, maoto, extract suppository against pediatric febrile symptoms].
19483419|a|A traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Kampo medicine, maoto, has been widely used in the treatment of febrile symptoms caused by viral infection. This herbal extract granule for oral use, however, is not well accepted by infants or young children due to its unpleasant taste and odor. Therefore, we prepared Kampo medicine, maoto, suppository and investigated the pharmaceutical and clinical efficacy of the suppository. Kampo medicine, maoto, granules were micro-pulverized and homogeneously dispersed into Hosco-H15 to prepare suppositories containing 0.25 to 1.0 g herbal extract by the conventional fusion method. Content of l-ephedrine, an index compound of Kampo medicine, maoto, in the extract granules and suppositories was determined by using a high performance liquid chromatographic method. Physicochemical experiments revealed that the suppository containing 0.5 g herbal extract had the most suitable melting point of 34 degrees C. Contents of l-ephedrine in the suppository were constant, 93-96% of those in the same amount of the extract granules in different three lots. Upper and lower portions of the suppository had the same content of l-ephedrine. The suppository maintained more than 95% of l-ephedrine content through 6 months at 4 degrees C, room temperature and 40 degrees C, although maldistribution of the extract constituent was observed after storage at 40 degrees C. The suppository was administered to 21 pediatric febrile patients at a dose of 1/3 to 2 full pieces depending on their body weight and physical status. Significant reduction (p<0.001) of body temperature from 39.5 to 37.5 degrees C without serious adverse effects was observed in 17 patients who were monitored the clinical effects on the febrile symptoms. In conclusion, Kampo medicine, maoto, suppository was found to satisfy the physicochemical quality and quantity standards as well as to be clinically applicable to neonates, infants and children with viral febrile symptoms without any adverse effects.

23745743|t|Early therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza A (H1N1) pdm 2009 infection.
23745743|a|BACKGROUND: Neuraminidase inhibitors have been reported to decrease mortality in patients infected with influenza A (H1N1) pdm 2009 (H1N1 pdm09), but it is not clear whether they are effective against H1N1pdm09 in apparently healthy children. METHODS: The effect of early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors on 70 otherwise healthy children with possible H1N1 pdm09 (pH1N1pdm09) infection was investigated. The children were simultaneously treated with a neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir or zanamivir) and maoto, a Japanese traditional herbal medicine, which had been reported to be effective against seasonal influenza. Clinical severity was assessed using patient history, namely the worst values for clinical vital signs and laboratory data on admission. After refining these parameters with univariate, decision tree and multiple regression analysis, mean covariance structure equation analysis was used to investigate the association of estimated clinical severity to the selected parameters. RESULTS: Total path analysis using a Bayesian method indicated that the estimated clinical severity of pH1N1pdm09 was positively associated with maximum body temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate, duration necessary for defervescence, admission duration and log urinary b2-microglobulin/creatinine level, and negatively associated with age and the presence and duration of treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor in the outpatient clinic. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first clinical evidence that early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors in outpatient clinic decreased the estimated clinical severity of pH1N1pdm09 in apparently otherwise healthy pediatric inpatients.

27376063|t|Efficient Use of a Crude Drug/Herb Library Reveals Ephedra Herb As a Specific Antagonist for TH2-Specific Chemokine Receptors CCR3, CCR4, and CCR8.
27376063|a|Chemokine receptors CCR3 and CCR4 are preferentially expressed by TH2 cells, mast cells, and/or eosinophils, all of which are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Therefore, CCR3 and CCR4 have long been highlighted as potent therapeutic targets for allergic diseases. Japanese traditional herbal medicine Kampo consists of multiple crude drugs/herbs, which further consist of numerous chemical substances. Recent studies have demonstrated that such chemical substances appear to promising sources in the development of novel therapeutic agents. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Kampo-related crude drugs/herbs would contain chemical substances that inhibit the cell migration mediated by CCR3 and/or CCR4. To test this hypothesis, we screened 80 crude drugs/herbs to identify candidate substances using chemotaxis assay. Among those tested, Ephedra Herb inhibited the chemotaxis mediated by both CCR3 and CCR4, Cornus Fruit inhibited that mediated by CCR3, and Rhubarb inhibited that mediated by CCR4. Furthermore, Ephedra Herb specifically inhibited the chemotaxis mediated by not only CCR3 and CCR4 but CCR8, all of which are selectively expressed by TH2 cells. This result led us to speculate that ephedrine, a major component of Ephedra Herb, would play a central role in the inhibitory effects on the chemotaxis mediated by CCR3, CCR4, and CCR8. However, ephedrine exhibited little effects on the chemotaxis. Therefore, we fractionated Ephedra Herb into four subfractions and examined the inhibitory effects of each subfraction. As the results, ethyl acetate-insoluble fraction exhibited the inhibitory effects on chemotaxis and calcium mobilization mediated by CCR3 and CCR4 most significantly. In contrast, chloroform-soluble fraction exhibited a weak inhibitory effect on the chemotaxis mediated by CCR8. Furthermore, maoto, one of the Kampo formulations containing Ephedra Herb, exhibited the inhibitory effects on the chemotaxis mediated by CCR3, CCR4, and CCR8. Taken together, our data suggest that these crude drugs/herbs might be useful sources to develop new drugs targeting TH2-mediated allergic diseases.

27055821|t|Prevention and Treatment of Influenza, Influenza-Like Illness, and Common Cold by Herbal, Complementary, and Natural Therapies.
27055821|a|UNASSIGNED: In recent years viral respiratory tract infections, especially influenza viruses, have had a major impact on communities worldwide as a result of unavailability of effective treatment or vaccine. The frequent alterations in the antigenic structures of respiratory viruses, particularly for RNA viruses, pose difficulties in production of effective vaccines. The unavailability of optimal medication and shortage of effective vaccines suggests the requirement for alternative natural therapies. Several herbal remedies were used for prevention and treatment viral respiratory illnesses. Among those that were found effective included maoto, licorice roots, antiwei, North American ginseng, berries, Echinacea, plants extracted carnosic acid, pomegranate, guava tea, and Bai Shao. There is scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of several complementary therapies for colds. Oral zinc may reduce the length and severity of a cold. Taking vitamin C supplements on a regular basis only slightly reduces the length and severity of colds. Probiotics were found better than placebo in reducing the number episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infections, the rate of episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infection and reducing antibiotic use. Alkaline diets or drinks might have antiviral properties as in vitro studies demonstrated inactivation effect of alkaline medium on respiratory virus. Earthing might have a natural anti-inflammatory effect for human body. It is now accepted that an overwhelming inflammatory response is the cause of human deaths from avian H5N1 influenza infection. Earthing accelerates immune response following vaccination, as demonstrated by increases of gamma globulin concentration. No in vivo or clinical studies were found that investigate the role of alkalization or earthing on respiratory viral infections. Thus, future studies are recommended to reveal any potential curative effects.

1914033|t|[Treatment of breast proliferation disease with modified xiao yao san and er chen decoction].
1914033|a|The authors report the 3 months' treatment of 51 cases of breast proliferation disease with modified Xiao Yao San and Er Chen decoction, an effective rate being 96.1%. In each patient before and after treatment, saliva estradiol (SE2), saliva progesterone (SP), saliva testosterone (ST) and plasma prolactin (PRL) concentrations were monitored and breast molybdenum-target X-ray films were taken. The results showed that after treatment, SE2 concentrations declined very significantly (P less than 0.001); SP concentrations declined significantly (P less than 0.05); PRL concentrations declined very significantly (P less than 0.005), but ST concentrations did not change significantly. Breast molybdenum-target X-ray films showed absorption of proliferation masses in 21 cases. These indicated that the medicine could regulate endocrine system, perhaps through suppressing secretion of PRL, decreasing prolactin antagonist action to follicular stimulating hormone so as to restore follicle function, and could regulate pituitary-follicle axis and make the axis normal.

21869903|t|Chinese herbal formula xiao yao san for treatment of depression: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
21869903|a|Objectives. To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of Xiaoyaosan for depression. Search Strategy. Electronic databases were searched until December 2009. Inclusion Criteria. We included randomized clinical trials testing Xiaoyaosan against placebo, antidepressants, or combined with antidepressants against antidepressants alone. Data Extraction and Analyses. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results. 26 randomized trials (involving 1837 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that Xiaoyaosan combined with antidepressants was more effective in comprehensive effect, the score of HAMD and the score of SDS compared with antidepressants alone. Xiaoyaosan was superior to antidepressants for the score of HAMD. However, Xiaoyaosan was not different from placebo for the score of SDS. There was no adverse effects reported in the trials from Xiaoyaosan. Conclusions. Xiaoyaosan appears to be effective on improving symptoms in patients with depression. However, due to poor methodological quality in the majority of included trials, the potential benefit from Xiaoyaosan need to be confirmed in rigorous trials and the design and reporting of trials should follow international standards.

10675182|t|Herb-drug interactions.
10675182|a|Concurrent use of herbs may mimic, magnify, or oppose the effect of drugs. Plausible cases of herb-drug interactions include: bleeding when warfarin is combined with ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba), garlic (Allium sativum), dong quai (Angelica sinensis), or danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza); mild serotonin syndrome in patients who mix St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors; decreased bioavailability of digoxin, theophylline, cyclosporin, and phenprocoumon when these drugs are combined with St John's wort; induction of mania in depressed patients who mix antidepressants and Panax ginseng; exacerbation of extrapyramidal effects with neuroleptic drugs and betel nut (Areca catechu); increased risk of hypertension when tricyclic antidepressants are combined with yohimbine (Pausinystalia yohimbe); potentiation of oral and topical corticosteroids by liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra); decreased blood concentrations of prednisolone when taken with the Chinese herbal product xaio chai hu tang (sho-salko-to); and decreased concentrations of phenytoin when combined with the Ayurvedic syrup shankhapushpi. Anthranoid-containing plants (including senna [Cassia senna] and cascara [Rhamnus purshiana]) and soluble fibres (including guar gum and psyllium) can decrease the absorption of drugs. Many reports of herb-drug interactions are sketchy and lack laboratory analysis of suspect preparations. Health-care practitioners should caution patients against mixing herbs and pharmaceutical drugs.

21177084|t|A pilot study of the multiherb Kampo medicine bakumondoto for cough in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
21177084|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of bakumondoto, Kampo medicine, on cough in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN: A 16-week, randomized, open-labeled, cross-over design. SETTING: Outpatient clinics at one university hospital and two general hospitals in Japan from May 2007 to March 2009. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four elderly patients (14 men and 9 women aged over 65) with COPD. INTERVENTION: Treatment with or without bakumondoto for 8 weeks in a cross-over design. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measurements were the frequency and intensity of cough assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a daily cough diary. Secondary outcome measurements were quality of life (QOL) assessed using St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and lung functions measured using spirometry. RESULTS: Treatment with bakumondoto significantly improved cough severity during the first treatment period (week 0 vs. week 8, p=0.004) and showed a trend to decrease during the second treatment period (week 8 vs. week 16, p=0.129) assessed by the VAS. Neither QOL nor lung function was affected by the treatment with bakumondoto. CONCLUSION: Bakumondoto may be effective in suppressing cough in elderly patients with COPD. To further confirm the efficacy, a larger and placebo-controlled study with objective cough assessment is necessary.

21514123|t|Antitussive effect of bakumondoto a fixed kampo medicine (six herbal components) for treatment of post-infectious prolonged cough: controlled clinical pilot study with 19 patients.
21514123|a|Bakumondoto (TJ-29) is a traditional herbal medicine that has been used in Japan for the treatment of bronchitis, bronchial asthma, and cough. This study investigated the effect of TJ-29 for the treatment of post-infectious prolonged cough. We performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial treating patients without (group A, n=11) or with TJ-29 (group B, n=8) for a total of 2 weeks using a beta 2 stimulant as the basal agent. Efficacy and safety were compared by a cough diary, VAS and sleeping questionnaire. At 4 and 5 days after treatment, the cough score of group B showed significant improvement compared with group A, demonstrating an early antitussive effect. At the assessment 2 weeks after treatment start, both groups showed similar levels of improvement in the cough score. No significant difference was observed in the VAS and the sleeping questionnaire items. In conclusion, oral TJ-29 administration could be useful and safe for the treatment of post-infectious prolonged cough.

26840418|t|Herbal Medicine for Cough: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
26840418|a|BACKGROUND: The aim of this review was to systematically assess the literature on herbal medicine for cough as a symptom of upper respiratory tract infections and common cold. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Embase were searched through March 2012 for RCTs testing the effects of herbal medicine for cough. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. RESULTS: 34 RCTs (N = 7,083) on Pelargonium sidoides (11 RCTs), Echinacea (8 RCTs), Andrographis paniculata (6 RCTs), ivy/primrose/thyme (4 RCTs), essential oils (4 RCTs) and bakumondoto (1 RCT) were included. Controls were mainly placebo. Most studies had a low risk of bias. The meta-analysis revealed strong evidence for A. paniculata (SMD = -1.00, 95% CI = -1.85, -0.15; P<0.001) and ivy/primrose/thyme (RR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.23, 1.60; P<0.001) in treating cough; moderate evidence for P. sidiodes (RR = 4.60; 95% CI = 2.89,7.31; P<0.001), and limited evidence for Echinacea (SMD = -0.68; 95% CI = -1.32, -0.04; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This review found strong evidence for A. paniculata and ivy/primrose/thyme-based preparations and moderate evidence for P. sidoides being significantly superior to placebo in alleviating the frequency and severity of patients' cough symptoms. Additional research, including other herbal treatments, is needed in this area.

23812198|a|Although the link between pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and exposure to certain drugs has already been identified, we herein present the first case of herbal medicine-associated PAH in which the patient demonstrated spontaneous remission. A 38-year-old woman took the herbal medicine "bofutsushosan" for two weeks then stopped taking it due to exertional dyspnea. However, her dyspnea continued, and right heart catheterization revealed a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 41 mmHg with a normal wedge pressure. Several months after treatment with oxygen therapy, the patient's dyspnea disappeared, and her pulmonary arterial pressure normalized. Further studies focusing on susceptibility factors to drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension are needed.

18385834|t|Bofutsushosan, an Oriental Herbal Medicine, Attenuates the Weight Gain of White Adipose Tissue and the Increased Size of Adipocytes Associated with the Increase in Their Expression of Uncoupling Protein 1 in High-Fat Diet-Fed Male KK/Ta mice.
18385834|a|Bofutsushosan (BOF), an oriental herbal medicine, has been used as an anti-obesity drug in overweight patients. In the present study, to evaluate the anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of BOF, we investigated the effects of BOF on the white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, the size of adipocytes, adiponectin expression, and oral glucose tolerance test results in high-fat diet-fed male KK/Ta mice. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and UCP2 mRNA in WAT and brown adipose tissue (BAT) were measured. 6-week-old KK/Ta mice were divided into four groups and fed a purified powdered basal diet (the BD group), a purified high-fat (HF) powdered diet containing suet powder at 37.5 g/100 g diet (the HF group), a high-fat diet plus 1.0% bofutsushosan (BOF) treatment (the HF + BOF group), or a high-fat diet plus 1.0% daisaikoto (DAI) treatment (the HF + DAI group) for 4 weeks. The weight of WAT and the size of adipocytes were increased in the HF group compared with those in the BD group, and these increases in the HF group were significantly inhibited in the HF + BOF group, but not affected in the HF + DAI group. There were no statistically significant differences in plasma levels and tissue mRNA levels of adiponectin among the four groups. There were no significant differences in UCP1 mRNA expression of BAT among the four groups. The expression of UCP1 mRNA in WAT was found in the HF + BOF group, but little expression was seen in the WAT of the BD, HF, or HF + DAI groups. The elevated plasma glucose levels and responses after the glucose loading in the HF group tended to decrease in the HF + BOF group. These results suggest that BOF decreases the weight and size gains of WAT along with up-regulating UCP1 mRNA in WAT in high-fat diet-fed mice.

23878593|t|Chinese herbal medicine qi ju di huang wan for the treatment of essential hypertension: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.
23878593|a|Background. Chinese herbs are potentially effective for hypertension. Qi Ju Di Huang Wan (QJDHW) is a commonly used Chinese herbal medicine as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents for the treatment of essential hypertension (EH). However, there is no critically appraised evidence such as systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the effectiveness and safety of QJDHW for EH. Methods and Findings. CENTRAL, PubMed, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and online clinical trial registry websites were searched for published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of QJDHW for essential hypertension up to January 2013 with no language restrictions. A total of 10 randomized trials involving 1024 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that QJDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs was more effective in lowering blood pressure and improving TCM syndrome for the treatment of essential hypertension than antihypertensive drugs used alone. No trials reported severe adverse events related to QJDHW. Conclusions. Our review suggests that QJDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs might be an effective treatment for lowering blood pressure and improving symptoms in patients with essential hypertension. However, the finding should be interpreted with caution because of the poor methodological quality of included trials. There is an urgent need for well-designed, long-term studies to assess the effectiveness of QJDHW in the treatment of essential hypertension.

24828204|t|Inhibitory effects of palmultang on inflammatory mediator production related to suppression of NF-kB and MAPK pathways and induction of HO-1 expression in macrophages.
24828204|a|Palmultang (PM) is an herbal decoction that has been used to treat anorexia, anemia, general prostration, and weakness due to chronic illness since medieval times in Korea, China, and Japan. The present study focused on the inhibitory effects of PM on the production of inflammatory factors and on the activation of mechanisms in murine macrophages. PM suppressed the expression of nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory proteins by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF)-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways and by inducing heme oxygenase (HO)-1 expression. Collectively, our results explain the anti-inflammatory effect and inhibitory mechanism of PM in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

7783463|t|Effects of chai ling tang on proteinuria in rat models.
7783463|a|Effects of Chai Ling Tang (a decoction of medicinal herbs) on passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) in rats, a model similar to human membranous nephropathy, were examined. Four hundred mg/kg (body weight) of Chai Ling Tang, or 240 mg/kg B.W. of Xiao Chai Hu Tang, or 130 mg/kg B.W. of Chai Hu (Radix Bupleuri), Ban Xia (Rhizoma Pinelliae) and Sheng Jiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens) were intraperitoneally injected respectively into three groups of female Wistar rats once a day starting from 5 days before intravenous injection of anti-FxlA antibody to the end of the experiment. Another group of rats intraperitoneally injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as the control. It was found that the excretion of urinary protein was significantly suppressed in the Chai Ling Tang treated group (52.2 +/- 46.9 mg/day) as compared to that in the PBS control group (276.5 +/- 127.0 mg/day) 15 days after anti-FxlA antibody injection (P < 0.01). The decrease of serum albumin and total protein, and the increase of serum total cholesterol were significantly inhibited in the Chai Ling Tang treated group as compared to that in the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively). It is therefore concluded that proteinuria in PHN can be significantly suppressed by Chai Ling Tang.

23680047|t|Lactobacillus fermentation enhances the inhibitory effect of Hwangryun-haedok-tang in an ovariectomy-induced bone loss.
23680047|a|BACKGROUND: Hwangryun-haedok-tang (HRT) is traditional herbal medicine used to treat inflammatory-related diseases in Asia. However, its effect on osteoclastogenesis and bone loss is still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of HRT and its fermented product (fHRT) on the receptor activator for the nuclear factor-kB ligand-induced osteoclastogenesis using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and postmenopausal bone loss using an ovariectomy (OVX) rat model. METHODS: Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was employed to evaluate osteoclast formation. mRNA level of transcription factor and protein levels of signaling molecules were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. Effect of HRT or fHRT on OVX-induced bone loss was evaluated using OVX rats orally administered HRT, or fHRT with 300 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Micro-CT analysis of femora was performed to analyze bone parameter. RESULTS: HRT or fHRT treatment significantly decreased TRAP activity and the number of TRAP positive multinuclear cells on osteoclastogenesis. Interestingly, these inhibitory effects of HRT were enhanced by fermentation. Furthermore, fHRT significantly inhibited mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1, which leads to down-regulation of NFATc1-regulated mRNA expressions such as TRAP, the d2 isoform of vacuolar ATPase V(0) domain, and cathepsin K. Administration of fHRT significantly inhibited the decrease of bone mineral density, and improved bone parameter of femora more than that of HRT and vehicle in OVX rats. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that lactic bacterial fermentation fortifies the inhibitory effect of HRT on osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. These results suggest that fermented HRT might have the beneficial potential on osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.

23082080|t|Hwangryun-Haedok-Tang Fermented with Lactobacillus casei Suppresses Ovariectomy-Induced Bone Loss.
23082080|a|Hwangryun-haedok-tang (HRT) is the common recipe in traditional Asian medicine, and microbial fermentation is used for the conventional methods for processing traditional medicine. We investigated the inhibitory effect of the n-butanol fraction of HRT (HRT-BU) and fHRT (fHRT-BU) on the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in bone-marrow-derived macrophages. mRNA expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes were evaluated by real-time QPCR. The activation of signaling pathways was determined by western blot analysis. The marker compounds of HRT-BU and fHRT-BU were analyzed by HPLC. The inhibitory effect of HRT or fHRT on ovariectomy-induced bone loss were evaluated using OVX rats with orally administered HRT, fHRT (300, 1000   mg/kg), or its vehicle for 12 weeks. fHRT-BU significantly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, and phosphorylation of p38, IKKa/b, and NF-kBp65 compared to HRT-BU. In addition, fHRT-BU also significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of Nfkb2, TNF-a, NFATc1, TRAP, ATPv0d2, and cathepsin K. Furthermore, administration of fHRT had a greater effect on the increase of BMD, and greater improved bone microstructure of the femora than that of HRT in ovariectomy rats. This study demonstrated that bacterial fermentation enhances the inhibitory effect of HRT on osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. These results suggest that fermented HRT might have the beneficial effects on bone disease by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis.

The results showed that Zhu Yu Hua Tan Tang plus general treatment can better improved the conscious state of the patients than western medicine, and it can make the intracranial pressure drop clinically by 40.44%. The intracranial pressure-lowering effect of Zhu Yu Hua Tan Tang, though slow, is smooth and long-lasting without any rebound phenomenon, as compared to those of mannitol. Similar results were found in animal experiments, but the intracranial pressure-lowering amplitude of Zhu Yu Hua Tan Tang was stronger than that of mannitol. The difference between the clinical and experimental results needs to be further studied.

20723593|t|Liu wei di huang wan, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, induces CYP1A2 while suppressing CYP2A6 and N-acetyltransferase 2 activities in man.
20723593|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Liu wei di huang wan (LDW), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is frequently combined with other prescription or non-prescription drugs in China. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was designed to investigate the effects of LDW on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and xanthine oxidase (XO) in healthy subjects, using caffeine as a probe drug. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve unrelated healthy males were enrolled in a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-phase crossover study. Placebo or LDW (12 pills, 0.2 g/pill, twice daily) was given to each participant for 14 continuous days with a wash-out period of 2 weeks. A dose of 100 mg caffeine was given afterwards to test the activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes of interest. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, LDW significantly induced the CYP1A2 activity, as determined by an increase in the ratio of (AFMU+1U+1X)/17U and the formation of 17X and 1X after taking caffeine. Interestingly, LDW significantly decreased the ratio of 17U/(17U+17X+1X+1U+AFMU) and the formation of 17U (CYP2A6-mediated) (by 39.2%; 95%CI: 23.1-55.3%; P=0.026), and decreased the ratio of AFMU/(AFMU+1U+1X) and the formation of AFMU (NAT2-catalyzed) (by 26.2%; 95%CI: 9.2-61.6%; P=0.038), suggesting a marked inhibition of CYP2A6 and NAT2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: LDW can induce CYP1A2 and suppress CYP2A6 and NAT2 activities, and affect caffeine metabolism in vivo.

1554324|t|[Effect of saibokuto on mucociliary transport system in the airway--basic and clinical assessments].
1554324|a|We studied the effects of Saibokuto, an antiasthmatic agent, on the airway mucociliary transport system. The addition of Saibokuto to a Rose chamber containing rabbit cultured tracheal epithelium dose-dependently increased ciliary beat frequency (CBF) as assessed by a photoelectric method: the maximal increase from the baseline value was 31.5 +/- 5.2% (p less than 0.001) and the concentration of Saibokuto required to produce a half-maximal effect (EC50) was 10(-4) mg/ml. This effect was not affected by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol or Ca(2+)-free medium, but was inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. Intracellular cyclic AMP levels were increased from 45.6 +/- 8.2 to 72.1 +/- 12.6 pmole/mg protein by 1.0 mg/ml Saibokuto (p less than 0.05). Thus, Saibokuto enhances ciliary motility probably through the synthesis of cyclooxygenase products and cyclic AMP. Additionally, administration of this drug to patients with chronic bronchitis, asthma and bronchiectasis improved their problems with sputum expectoration and reduced the amount of daily sputum (p less than 0.001). Therefore, Saibokuto may be of value in the treatment of patients with impaired mucociliary transport function in the airway.

25178444|t|Association of drinking patterns and health characteristics with beverage preference.
25178444|a|PURPOSES: To investigate the association between the type of preferred alcoholic beverage and drinking pattern and health characteristics. METHODS: A Cross-sectional study was conducted from 22 April to 3 May in 2002. 301 females and 699 males aged 13 to 59 were personally interviewed. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, drinking pattern and health characteristics were collected. 735 drinkers who were 19 year-old or over were included in analysis. Beverage preference was classified 3 categories: Beer drinker, wine drinker (including wine, makguly, chungju and yakju) and soju drinker (including soju and spirits). RESULTS: Beer drinkers were likely to be females. Compared to wine or soju drinkers, beer drinkers were less frequently drank, and consumed less total alcohol per week and less alcohol per 1 drinking among both male and female. Controlling for various confounders, beer drinker had significantly less total alcohol consumption per week, and alcohol consumption per 1 drinking than wine and soju drinker. CONCLUSIONS: Beer drinking were associated with less smoking in males and healthy drinking pattern in both gender than soju drinking.

17955980|t|Monitoring stevioside in soju by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.
17955980|a|A method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV absorption detection was developed to monitor stevioside in soju, a distilled spirits product that is commercially available. The method uses a single-step dilution for sample preparation. It completely eliminates the time-consuming process of solid-phase extraction. A method using HPLC/mass spectrometry was optimized to confirm the identities of stevioside and other related impurities, including rebaudioside A, rebaudioside C, and dulcoside. The method was validated. The validation parameters included range (10.1-1007.3 ppm), precision, linearity, accuracy, robustness, system suitability, and intermediate precision. Stevioside standard solutions at 6 concentration levels were prepared for the validation work, including the tests for precision, linearity, and accuracy. The solutions were prepared in triplicate for each concentration. The relative standard deviation for the precision test was <3% for all 6 concentration levels. The correlation coefficient for the linearity within the concentration range was determined to be > 0.999. The average recovery ranged from 95.7 to 101.1% for the soju samples spiked with stevioside standard. The detection limit for stevioside was estimated at 75 ppb. The method was used to screen several soju samples; no detectable stevioside was found in the samples.

20359726|t|Association between alcohol consumption and bone strength in Korean adults: the Korean Genomic Rural Cohort Study.
20359726|a|Previous studies have reported an inconsistent relationship between alcohol consumption and bone health. A growing body of research has shown that chronic alcoholism leads to osteopenia and increased incidence of skeletal fractures, but some studies have concluded that alcohol consumption may be associated with higher bone mineral density in elderly populations. However, most studies showing a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and bone status have been in Western countries; and subjects have usually been postmenopausal women. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of alcohol consumption with bone strength in Korean adults. Data were from the Korean Genomic Rural Cohort Study, which is an ongoing population-based study of adults aged 40 to 70 years from 5 regions. A total of 7713 participants (3368 men, 4345 women) were surveyed about their annual consumption of alcohol such as soju, beer, makkolli, wine, and whisky. Bone strength was measured by stiffness index using the calcaneal quantitative ultrasound method. Overall, the annual age-specific decrease rate in the stiffness index of women was 2.7 times higher than that of men (0.463% for women, 0.169% for men).After adjustment for eligible covariates, the association between alcohol consumption and risk of reduced bone strength showed a J-shaped curve for both men and women. Compared with nondrinkers, the relative risk of reduced bone strength was 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.83) in men who drank 4 to 5 cups of soju for an amount of 29.626 to 49.375 g of alcohol per day and 0.61 (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.86) in men who drank 6 to 7 cups of soju for an amount of 49.376 to 69.125 g of alcohol per day. We found no significant relationship between alcohol consumption and bone strength in any other group of men. For women, results suggested that the risk of reduced bone strength was lower in the moderate-consumption group; but no significant relationship was found between alcohol consumption at any level and bone strength. Among Korean adults, alcohol consumption has a J-shaped relationship with risk of reduced bone strength.

27186604|t|Analysis of alcohol-induced DNA damage in Escherichia coli by visualizing single genomic DNA molecules.
27186604|a|UNASSIGNED: Consumption of alcohol injures DNA, and such damage is considered to be a primary cause for the development of cancer and many other diseases essentially due to reactive oxygen species generated from alcohol. To sensitively detect alcohol-induced DNA lesions in a biological system, we introduced a novel analytical platform for visualization of single genomic DNA molecules using E. coli. By fluorescently labelling the DNA lesions, our approach demonstrated, with the highest sensitivity, that we could count the number of DNA lesions induced by alcohol metabolism in a single bacterial cell. Moreover, our results showed a linear relationship between ethanol concentration and the number of DNA lesions: 0.88 lesions per 1% ethanol. Using this approach, we quantitatively analysed the DNA damage induced by exposure to alcoholic beverages such as beer (5% ethanol), rice wine (13%), soju (20%), and whisky (40%).

23392877|t|Dietary taurine and nutrient intake and dietary quality by alcohol consumption level in Korean male college students.
23392877|a|Heavy alcohol consumption is related to various negative healthy consequences. To investigate difference of taurine intake according to the alcohol consumption level, we studied body composition, intake of dietary nutrients including taurine, and dietary quality in Korean male college students that were divided according to their alcohol consumption level. Surveys were conducted using a questionnaire and a 3-day recall method for assessing dietary intake in 220 male college students residing in Incheon, Korea. The subjects were divided into two groups by alcohol consumption level: heavy drinking group (average drinking over 5 cans (355 ml) of beer or 7 shots (45 ml) of soju) and light drinking group (average drinking less than 5 cans of beer or 7 shots of soju or not drinking any alcohol at all at one time during the previous month). The average body mass index (BMI) in the heavy drinking group was significantly higher compared to the light drinking group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in dietary taurine intake between heavy and light drinking group. With regard to the dietary quality evaluation of the subjects, the nutrient densities (ND) of carbohydrate, niacin, vitamin C, and zinc in the heavy drinking group were significantly lower than those of the light drinking group. Therefore, continuous nutrition education for heavy drinking Korean male college students may be needed to improve balanced nutritional status and further studies such as case-control study or taurine intervention study are required to know the relationship between dietary taurine intake and alcohol consumption.

14691073|t|Type of alcoholic beverage and high-risk drinking: how risky is beer drinking in Korea?
14691073|a|AIMS: To examine the association of beverage type with high-risk drinking in Korea. METHODS: Data were analysed from the Korea's 1997 behavioural risk factor surveillance system survey collected by a stratified random sampling method (n = 1045). After alcohol consumption per drinking day was categorized into three risk levels for short-term or 'acute' harm on the basis of the World Health Organization's guidelines, logistic regression analysis adjusting for socio-demographic factors was performed for each beverage type. RESULTS: Using beer drinkers as the reference, those who drank soju (the most widely consumed traditional beverage in Korea) showed an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 3.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.28-5.76] for high and very high risk from drinking and those who drank spirits had adjusted OR of 10.65 (95%CI = 4.32-26.27). CONCLUSIONS: In Korea, unlike in many western countries, beer is not the highest risk beverage. The relatively high price of beer in Korea is likely to be one influence. It is concluded that country-specific differences are important in studies on associations between alcoholic beverage types and high risk drinking.

20016717|t|Dietary patterns associated with hypertension among Korean males.
20016717|a|The objectives of this study were to identify the dietary patterns associated with hypertension among Korean males. Data from the 2001 Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey of 1,869 men aged 20-65 years were used for the analysis. As an initial analysis, a factor analysis was applied to identify major dietary patterns among the subjects. Then logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the pattern related with hypertension. As a result of the initial analysis, three major dietary patterns were identified. Dietary pattern 1 (traditional) was heavily loaded with vegetables, fish and cereal. Dietary pattern 2 (Western) was loaded with fast foods, bread, meats and dairy products. Dietary pattern 3 (Drinker) was loaded with mostly pork, beer and soju (Korean liquor). From the second stage of the analysis, there was a tendency of positive association between traditional patterns and hypertension risks. However, the tendency did not meet statistical significance level (p<0.05). In summary, unlikely findings from European and American studies, vegetables rich traditional dietary patterns did not show any protective effect on hypertension in Korean males. The Korean dietary practice, which is consuming salted vegetables instead of fresh vegetables, might have played a role in these findings. However, the full explanation of the findings remained to be answered with further investigation since none of the dietary patterns identified showed any statistical significance.

20168057|t|[The relationship between the popular beverages in Korea and reported postprandial heartburn].
20168057|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of heartburn produced by beverages available in Korea and to clarify the mechanism causing heartburn. METHODS: We measured pH, titratable acidity, and osmolality of 35 beverages in vitro and correlated them with the severity of heartburn reported by questionnaire in 382 patients from November 2004 to June 2005. RESULTS: Coffee (1.15) and soju (1.12) showed the highest heartburn score, while oolong tea (0.17) and carrot juice (0.18) showed the lowest heartburn score among all beverages. Titratable acidity of citrus juices correlated with heartburn (r=0.78; p=0.023). Soft drinks had the lowest pH, which was unrelated with heartburn scores (r=-0.54; p=0.460). Increasing pH among alcoholic beverages was correlated with heartburn scores (r=0.84; p=0.037), and osmolality was inversely associated with heartburn scores (r=-0.86; p=0.028). The heartburn score of decaffeinated coffee was significantly lower than that of regular coffee (p<0.001). Regular milk caused more heartburn than low-fat milk (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide dietary information that helps to select appropriate beverages to the patients with heartburn.

27283695|t|Validation of analytical methods for ethyl carbamate in nine food matrices.
27283695|a|Ethyl carbamate (EC) is formed through a reaction between ethanol and either cyanate or N-carbamyl compounds. This study aimed to develop and validate analytical methods for EC determination in nine food matrices: apple juice, soju, milk, corn oil, rice porridge, peanut butter, beef, flat fish, and sea mustard. Differences from AOAC procedure were use of d5-EC as internal standard, dilution of alcohol content, removal of lipophilic compounds by hexane, and removal of hydrophilic polysaccharides by gel-forming. Standard curves had a good linearity (R(2)>0.997) in all matrices tested. LOD and LOQ were in the range of 0.69-6.08 g/kg and 2.10-18.43 g/kg, respectively. Recovery rates ranged from 80.75 to 121.82% for intra-day and ranged from 78.84 to 116.98% for inter-day. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were below 14%. These results indicate that the established methods can be applied to determine EC in a variety of foods.

23397143|t|Factors associated with gout in South Koreans: analysis using the National Health Insurance Corporation and the National Health Screening Exam databases.
23397143|a|The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with gout among South Koreans. A case control study of gout patients newly diagnosed between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008, and matching controls was conducted using the nationwide database (National Health Insurance Corporation and National Health Screening Exam (NHSE) database), which included the health-care records of 48.1 million individuals. Of 495,998 newly diagnosed patients, we included 18,123 who were >= 40 years old and had an NHSE before diagnosis of gout. To elucidate the factors associated with gout, multivariate conditional logistic analyses were performed. Gout was associated with drinking >= 1/week (p   <   0.001), drinking >= 1 bottle of soju/session (p   <   0.001), high body mass index (BMI) (p   <   0.001), high blood pressure (p   <   0.001), high total cholesterol (p   <   0.001), proteinuria (multivariate odds ratio (OR)   =   1.75; 95 % confidence interval (CI)   =   1.53-2.00), and an elevated uric acid (multivariate OR   =   1.54; 95 % CI   =   1.22-1.94). Exercise frequency was not significantly associated with gout. Prediabetic blood sugar level (100-125 mg/dL) was associated with gout in the univariate analysis, but not in the multivariate analysis. Diabetic blood sugar level (>= 126 mg/dL) was associated with a decreased odds of gout (multivariate OR   =   0.79; 95 % CI   =   0.73-0.86). Our nationwide South Korean study showed that frequent and excessive alcohol consumption, high BMI, high blood pressure, high total cholesterol, proteinuria, and high uric acid are associated with gout.

25185457|t|Alcohol consumption and persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus.
25185457|a|SUMMARY Alcohol consumption is a possible co-factor of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) persistence, a major step in cervical carcinogenesis, but the association between alcohol and continuous HPV infection remains unclear. This prospective study identified the association between alcohol consumption and HR-HPV persistence. Overall, 9230 women who underwent screening during 2002-2011 at the National Cancer Center, Korea were analysed in multivariate logistic regression. Current drinkers [odds ratio (OR) 2  49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1  32-4  71] and drinkers for    5 years (OR 2  33, 95% CI 1  17-4  63) had a higher risk of 2-year HR-HPV persistence (HPV positivity for 3 consecutive years) than non-drinkers and drinkers for <5 years, respectively (vs. HPV negativity for 3 consecutive years). A high drinking frequency (   twice/week) and a high beer intake (   3 glasses/occasion) had higher risks of 1-year (OR 1  80, 95% CI 1  01-3  36) HPV positivity for 2 consecutive years) and 2-year HR-HPV persistence (OR 3  62, 95% CI 1  35-9  75) than non-drinkers. Of the HPV-positive subjects enrolled, drinking habit (OR 2  68, 95% CI 1  10-6  51) and high consumption of beer or soju (   2 glasses/occasion; OR 2  90, 95% CI 1  06-7  98) increased the risk of 2-year consecutive or alternate HR-HPV positivity (vs. consecutive HPV negativity). These findings suggest that alcohol consumption might increase the risk of cervical HR-HPV persistence in Korean women.

20234107|t|Alcohol consumption and digestive cancer mortality in Koreans: the Kangwha Cohort Study.
20234107|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for cancers of the mouth, esophagus, liver, colon, and breast. In this study, we examined the association between alcohol consumption and digestive cancer mortality in Korean men and women. METHODS: A cohort of 6291 residents of Kangwha County who were aged 55 years or older in March 1985 were followed to 31 December 2005-a period of 20.8 years. We calculated the relative risks of cancer mortality with respect to the amount of alcohol consumed. Cox proportional hazard model was used to adjust for age at entry, smoking, ginseng intake, education status, and pesticide use. RESULTS: In men, the risks of mortality from esophageal cancer (relative risk [RR], 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-21.77) and colon cancer (RR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1.10-19.2) were higher among heavy drinkers, as compared with abstainers. The risks of mortality from colon cancer and bile duct cancer rose with increasing alcohol consumption; these trends were positive and statistically significant (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively). When participants were stratified by type of alcoholic beverage, soju drinkers had higher risks of mortality from esophageal cancer and colon cancer than makkoli drinkers. In women, the risk of digestive cancer mortality was higher among alcohol drinkers than abstainers, but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption increases mortality from esophageal cancer and colon cancer in men.

26519539|t|Moderate alcohol intake reduces risk of ischemic stroke in Korea.
26519539|a|OBJECTIVE: We undertook a population-based, case-control study to examine a dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and risk of ischemic stroke in Koreans who had different alcoholic beverage type preferences than Western populations and to examine the effect modifications by sex and ischemic stroke subtypes. METHODS: Cases (n = 1,848) were recruited from patients aged 20 years or older with first-ever ischemic stroke. Stroke-free controls (n = 3,589) were from the fourth and fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and were matched to the cases by age (  3 years), sex, and education level. All participants completed an interview using a structured questionnaire about alcohol intake. RESULTS: Light to moderate alcohol intake, 3 or 4 drinks (1 drink = 10 g ethanol) per day, was significantly associated with a lower odds of ischemic stroke after adjusting for potential confounders (no drinks: reference; <1 drink: odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.32-0.45; 1-2 drinks: 0.45, 0.36-0.57; and 3-4 drinks: 0.54, 0.39-0.74). The threshold of alcohol effect in women was slightly lower than that in men (up to 1-2 drinks in women vs up to 3-4 drinks in men), but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no statistical interaction between alcohol intake and the subtypes of ischemic stroke (p = 0.50). The most frequently used alcoholic beverage was one native to Korea, soju (78% of the cases), a distilled beverage with 20% ethanol by volume. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that light to moderate distilled alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in Koreans.

25436025|t|Trends in the epidemiological aspects and mortality of alcoholic liver disease in Korea in the decade between 2000 and 2009.
25436025|a|BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption and related alcohol liver disease (ALD) have substantially increased in Korea during the last decade. The objective of this study was to evaluate the trends in the epidemiological aspects and mortality rate (MR) of Korea in the decade between 2000 and 2009. METHODS: The raw data analyzed in this study were obtained from the website of "the ALD" managed by Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Korea Public Health Association (KPHA), and statistics website of Statistics Korea. The data analyses were performed using Excel 2007 statistical software (Microsoft Corp., USA). RESULTS: The amount of alcohol-consumption-per-capita-per-year (ACCY) in Korea was 8.38 L in 2000 and 8.54 L in 2009. The most taken alcoholic beverage was soju, followed by beer. There were a total of 1,403 case-fatalities (CF) with an MR of 2.98 per 100,000 populations of ALD in 2000, while a total of 3,588 CF with an MR of 7.21 in 2009 (P < 0.01). The CF and MR of ALD in males were significantly higher than those in females (P < 0.01). In over 40-year-old age groups, the CF and MR were significantly increased (P < 0.01). Moreover, occupational classification revealed that the mistress/students/jobless (MSJ) were the most risky group. The comparison of overall CF and MR of ALD by six key classifications (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)) showed that alcoholic cirrhosis (229 CF and 16.3%) in 2000 tended to be increased in 2009 (2,803 CF and 78.1%), while alcoholic fibrosis and sclerosis (607 CF and 43.3%) in 2000 significantly decreased in 2009 (120 CF and 3.3%), respectively. CONCLUSION: ALD is one of the most severe diseases in Korea, as indicated by its high CF and MR in this study. As over-consumption of alcoholic beverages is relatively common in Korea, more efforts should be made toward prevention of ALD by raising awareness of the risk factors of ALD by public health education.

8774209|t|The clinical spectrum of Jin Bu Huan toxicity.
8774209|a|Herbal medications and other nontraditional medical therapies are becoming increasingly popular in the United States. We describe three children and three adults in whom severe toxic effects developed after ingestion of a Chinese herbal medication, jin bu huan, which is sold as Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets. Jin bu huan produced distinct clinical syndromes after acute ingestion in children and long-term use in adults. A single, acute ingestion in children rapidly produced life-threatening neurologic and cardiovascular manifestations, while long-term jin bu huan use in adults was associated with hepatitis. Jin bu huan contains levo-tetrahydropalmatine, a potent neuroactive substance. The constituents of jin bu huan are misidentified on the package, resulting in significant delay in identifying the plant alkaloid responsible for its toxicity. Although perceived as innocuous, jin bu huan may produce major health effects. The highly concentrated formulation, the lack of childproof packaging, and the product insert listing indications for the treatment of serious medical conditions may all contribute to the development of toxic reactions.

7944049|t|Acute hepatitis associated with the Chinese herbal product jin bu huan.
7944049|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the hepatotoxicity associated with ingestion of the Chinese herbal product Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets (Lycopodium, serratum) and to propose possible mechanisms of injury. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Academic hepatology units and private practice facilities. PATIENTS: Seven previously healthy patients. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and histologic studies. RESULTS: Acute hepatitis occurred after a mean of 20 weeks (range, 7 to 52 weeks) of Jin Bu Huan ingestion and resolved in six patients within a mean of 8 weeks (range, 2 to 30 weeks); another patient is currently improving. Hepatitis was associated with symptoms of fever, fatigue, nausea, pruritus, and abdominal pain and with signs of jaundice and hepatomegaly. Biopsy specimens showed that one patient had hepatitis with eosinophils (consistent with a drug reaction) and the other had mild hepatitis, moderate fibrosis, and microvesicular steatosis. Decreasing the Jin Bu Huan dose in one patient improved liver test results. Reusing Jin Bu Huan in two other patients caused abrupt recrudescence of hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Jin Bu Huan can cause liver injury. Although the hepatotoxic mechanisms are not defined, they may include hypersensitive or idiosyncratic reactions or direct toxicity to active metabolites. Hepatotoxicity caused by herbal products underscores the toxicity caused by herbal products underscores the importance of national surveillance programs and quality control of the manufacture of these products.

11475751|t|[An experimental study on curative effect of Chinese medicine qing yi tang in acute necrotizing pancreatitis].
11475751|a|OBJECTIVE: To observe the curative effect of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Qing Yi Tang (QYT) in acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP). METHODS: Twenty three dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups. In control group (n = 7), animals underwent laparotomy only. In ANP group (n = 8), acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by injection of 0.5 ml/kg 5% sodium taurocholate with 300 u/kg trypsin into the pancreatic duct. While in TCM group (n = 8) were fed everyday with QYT after onset of ANP. All animals were sacrified 7 days later and organs were gathered and cultured. Mucosal and luminal floras of the intestine were analysed. Pancreas and ileal mucosa were examined histologically and ultra-microscopically, the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and amylase in blood were determined. RESULTS: In TCM groups, histologic and ultra-structural damages in pancreas and ileal mucosa were much milder as compared with those of ANP group. In ANP group, there was a significant increase of E. coli and bacterocoids, and a significant decrease of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and enterococci in the intestinal mucosa, while in TCM groups, these changes were alleviated significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). As compared with ANP group, the bacterial translocation (BT) rate was reduced from 100% to 50%, and the counts of translocated bacteria were decreased 10-40 times, the levels of LPS and amylase reduced 2 to 3 times. CONCLUSION: TCM recipe QYT showed their protective effects on gut barrier function by alleviating the damage of intestinal mucosa and microecologic disturbance following acute pancreatitis. As a result, the chances of BT and enterogenic infection declined. These preparation might be promising in the prophylaxis and treatment of infection complicating ANP.

23690848|t|A systems biology-based investigation into the pharmacological mechanisms of wu tou tang acting on rheumatoid arthritis by integrating network analysis.
23690848|a|Aim. To investigate pharmacological mechanisms of Wu Tou Tang acting on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by integrating network analysis at a system level. Methods and Results. Drug similarity search tool in Therapeutic Targets Database was used to screen 153 drugs with similar structures to compositive compounds of each ingredient in Wu Tou Tang and to identify 56 known targets of these similar drugs as predicted molecules which Wu Tou Tang affects. The recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score, which were calculated to evaluate the performance of this method, were, respectively, 0.98, 0.61, 59.67%, and 0.76. Then, the predicted effector molecules of Wu Tou Tang were significantly enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and calcium signaling pathway. Next, the importance of these predicted effector molecules was evaluated by analyzing their network topological features, such as degree, betweenness, and k-coreness. We further elucidated the biological significance of nine major candidate effector molecules of Wu Tou Tang for RA therapy and validated their associations with compositive compounds in Wu Tou Tang by the molecular docking simulation. Conclusion. Our data suggest the potential pharmacological mechanisms of Wu Tou Tang acting on RA by combining the strategies of systems biology and network pharmacology.

2060051|t|[Da cheng qi tang on 45Ca content of the isolated colon smooth muscle from experimental colon obstruction rats].
2060051|a|Da Cheng Qi Tang (DCQT) is a classical prescription of Chinese medicine for treatment of acute intestinal obstruction. In this paper, the isolated colon smooth muscle from normal and experimental colon obstruction (CO) rats were used to study the effect of DCQT on 45Ca content. The results showed that the 45Ca content on isolated colon smooth muscle (microns/g wet tissue, mean +/- S) was 0.043 +/- 0.009 in the normal and 0.057 +/- 0.012 in those treated by DCQT respectively. The content of 45Ca in CO was higher than the normal, DCQT can reduce the content of 45Ca in CO. It is known that the higher level of intracellular CA++ is related to the formation and the development of acute intestinal obstruction. The inhibitory effect of DCQT on 45Ca content may play an important role in the treatment of acute colon obstruction.

26512754|t|Urban traffic pollution reduction for sedan cars using petrol engines by hydro-oxide gas inclusion.
26512754|a|UNASSIGNED: Petrol cars, in particular nonhybrid cars, contribute significantly to the pollution problem as compared with other types of cars. The originality of this article falls in the direction of using hydro-oxy gas to reduce pollution from petrol car engines. Experiments were performed in city areas at low real speeds, with constant engine speeds in the average of 2500 rpm and at variable velocity ratios (first speed was 10-20 km/hr, second speed was 20-35 km/hr, and third speed was 35-50 km/hr). Results indicated that through using hydro-oxy gas, a noticeable reduction in pollution was recorded. Oxygen (O2) percentage has increased by about 2.5%, and nitric oxide (NO) level has been reduced by about 500 ppm. Carbon monoxide (CO) has decreased by about 2.2%, and also CO2 has decreased by 2.1%. It's worth mentioning that for hybrid system in cars at speeds between 10 and 50 km/hr, the emission percentage change is zero. However, hybrid cars are less abundant than petrol cars. IMPLICATIONS: The originality of this paper falls in the direction of using hydro-oxy gas to reduce pollution from petrol car engines. Experiments were performed in city areas at low real speeds, with constant engine speeds in the average of 2500 rpm and at variable velocity ratios (first speed was 10-20 km/hr, second speed was 20-35 km/hr, and third speed was 35-50 km/h).

25275179|a|The objective of the present work was to determine the mean angles between different body segments of the car drivers depending on their position in various types of the vehicles ("sedan", "crossover", "minivan") at the moment immediately preceding emergency break application. The study was based on the experimental data obtained with the participation of volunteers and the results of simulation. These materials were treated with the use of the arithmetic mean, mean square deviation, and mean error. The rank correlation method was employed. The significance of the difference between the quantities of interest was estimated with the use of Student's t-table. The angles between different body segments of the car drivers depending on their position in various types of the vehicles ("sedan", "crossover", "minivan") were measured. The data obtained confirm that peculiarities of the driver's position in the car determine the mechanisms of the injuries related to a car incident.

21823947|t|An analysis of head impact severity in simulations of collisions between pedestrians and SUVs/work utility vehicles, and sedans.
21823947|a|OBJECTIVE: To describe the determinants of the severity of the head kinematics of a pedestrian when struck by common sport utility vehicles (SUV) and work utility vehicles (WUVs) to assess how effective assessment protocols are in assessing injury risk for SUVs and work utilities. METHODS: Three hundred twenty-four simulations of pedestrian collisions with SUVs, work utility vehicles, and sedans were performed using several vehicle geometries, pedestrian orientations, speeds, and braking levels. Contact stiffnesses in the models were based on impact test results with exemplar vehicle structures. A single contact characteristic was used for all head-to-hood contacts to allow the effects of other factors on head injury risk to be compared. Simulations of standard headform tests on the same hood characterized the structure from a subsystem test perspective. RESULTS: Head injury criterion values were higher in SUV/WUV simulations than sedan simulations because of high neck tension rather than through higher contact forces with the hood. In fact, the severity of the impact between the head and hood was slightly less in SUV/WUV simulations. Sedan and SUV/WUV simulations produced lower head injury criterion (HIC) values than did the subsystem tests. CONCLUSIONS: High bonnet leading edges led to increased neck loads in these simulations of pedestrian collisions. Neck loads were influential on head injury risk in the SUV/work utility simulations but not in sedan simulations. Subsystem impact tests may overestimate head impact risk from the hood itself but fail to capture a potentially important injury mechanism in collisions with vehicles with high leading edges and thus fail to differentiate completely risks posed by such vehicles. These results may have implications for the interpretation of pedestrian subsystem test results: a given HIC value in an SUV/WUV test may represent a relatively higher risk of injury than the same results recorded in a sedan test.

It was shown that the displacement patterns were significantly different in the drivers of "sedan", "jeep", and "minivan" car models. The different directions of centre of mass displacement account for the driver's contact with different structures of the passenger compartment. Hence, the different character of the resulting injuries.

18278607|t|Correlation of strain and loads measured in the long bones with observed kinematics of the lower limb during vehicle-pedestrian impacts.
18278607|a|The purpose of this study is to determine the loads in the long bones of the lower extremities during vehicle-pedestrian impact tests, and to correlate load data with observed kinematics in an effort to understand how stature and vehicle shape influence pedestrian response. In tests with a large sedan and a small multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), four post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) in mid-stance gait were struck laterally at 40 km/h. Prior to the tests, each PMHSwas instrumented with four uniaxial strain gages around the mid-shaft cross section of the struck-side (right) tibia and the femora bilaterally. After the tests, the non-fractured bones were harvested and subjected to three-point bending experiments. The effective elastic moduli were determined by relating the applied bending loads with the measured strains using strain gage locations, detailed bone geometry, and elastic beam theory. Using the strains measured in the vehicle-pedestrian tests and the calculated effective elastic moduli, the axial load and bending moments in the instrumented bone cross-sections were calculated. Peak longitudinal strains in the mid-shaft cross-sections approached 1% in the right tibiae and exceeded 0.5% in the right femora with peak strain rates of 200%s(-1)-750%s(-1) in the right tibiae and 100%s(-1)-170%s(-1) in the femora. While peak axial forces were consistent for both vehicles and ranged from 1 kN to 3 kN, bending moments in the right lower extremity exceeded 300 Nm in the sedan impacts but were substantially lower in impacts with the MPV. The right tibia bent predominantly in the medial direction during the impact whereas bi-modal patterns were observed in the sagittal bending moment time histories of the femora. Stature differences caused variations in hip and knee impact locations relative to the hood edge and bumper of each vehicle that may have been a contributing factor resulting in more severe struck-side lower extremity injuries in the tall subject tested with the MPV, and more severe struck-side lower extremity injuries in the shorter subject tested with the sedan.

12067110|t|Injury to the spinal cord in motor vehicle traffic crashes.
12067110|a|Motor vehicle traffic crashes (MVTCs) are the leading cause of traumatic spinal cord injury. Evidence of putative risk factors for this type of injury comes largely from descriptive studies. This study is the first case-control study of risk factors for spinal cord injury specifically in car crashes. Cases of occupant spinal cord injury in South Australia were identified from the Australian Spinal Cord Injury Register (ASCIR) which provides full coverage of the adult population. The comparison group was other seriously injured car occupants. In single vehicle car crashes in the country, the likelihood of spinal cord injury was five times higher for occupants of non-sedan type cars compared with sedans. The likelihood of spinal cord injury was especially high in non-sedan type cars involved in rollover crashes; ten times higher than sedans. The implications of the findings for prevention are highlighted. Concern is expressed over the increasing proportion of four wheel drive passenger vehicles (sport utility vehicles) in the car fleet in Australia, and in the USA, as they are more prone to rollover.

24564187|t|Delayed gait disturbance due to injury of the corticoreticular pathway in a patient with mild traumatic brain injury.
24564187|a|BACKGROUND: Many studies have demonstrated neural injury in patients with mild traumatic brain injury, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, knowledge regarding injury of the corticoreticular pathway (CRP) is limited. This study reports on a patient with mild TBI who showed delayed gait disturbance due to injury of the CRP following head trauma, which was demonstrated by DTI. METHODS: A 14-year-old female patient suffered from an in-car accident: her head was hit with the backseat during hyperextension after flexion movement when her sedan was struck by another sedan from behind. She showed mild quadriparesis after onset. At 29 days after onset, she noted gait disturbance and aggravated quadriparesis with more severe weakness of the proximal joints. RESULTS: No abnormality was observed on brain MRI and electromyography study performed at 10 weeks after onset. Both CRPs were discontinued at the midbrain level on 10-week DTI. CONCLUSION: It appears that the proximal weakness of this patient was attributed to injury of both CRPs following head trauma. It is assumed that the mild weakness at the onset of head trauma was caused by the primary traumatic axonal injury and the aggravated weakness that started from 29 days might be ascribed to the secondary traumatic axonal injury.

27261883|t|Measurements of major VOCs released into the closed cabin environment of different automobiles under various engine and ventilation scenarios.
27261883|a|UNASSIGNED: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in automobile cabins were measured quantitatively to describe their emission characteristics in relation to various idling scenarios using three used automobiles (compact, intermediate sedan, and large sedan) under three different idling conditions ([1] cold engine off and ventilation off, [2] exterior air ventilation with idling warm engine, and [3] internal air recirculation with idling warm engine). The ambient air outside the vehicle was also analyzed as a reference. A total of 24 VOCs (with six functional groups) were selected as target compounds. Accordingly, the concentration of 24 VOC quantified as key target compounds averaged 4.58      3.62  ppb (range: 0.05 (isobutyl alcohol)       38.2  ppb (formaldehyde)). Moreover, if their concentrations are compared between different automobile operational modes: the 'idling engine' levels (5.24      4.07) was 1.3-5 times higher than the 'engine off' levels (4.09      3.23) across all 3 automobile classes. In summary, automobile in-cabin VOC emissions are highly contingent on changes in engine and ventilation modes.

25509827|t|Distracted driver performance to multiple alerts in a multiple-conflict scenario.
25509827|a|OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether collision avoidance systems (CASs) should present individual crash alerts in a multiple-conflict scenario or present only one alert in response to the first conflict. BACKGROUND: Secondary alerts may startle, confuse, or interfere with drivers' execution of an emergency maneuver. METHOD: Fifty-one participants followed a pickup truck around a test track. Once the participant was visually distracted, a trailing sedan repositioned itself into the participant's blind spot while a box was dropped from the truck Participants received a forward collision warning (FCW) alert as the box landed. Twenty-six drivers swerved left in response to the box, encountering a lateral conflict with the adjacent sedan. Half of these 26 drivers received a lane-change merge (LCM) alert. RESULTS: Drivers who received both the FCW and LCM alerts were significantly faster at steering away from the lateral crash threat than the drivers who received only the FCW alert (1.70 s vs. 2.76 s, respectively). Drivers liked receiving the LCM alert, rated it to be useful, found it easy to understand (despite being presented after the FCW alert), and did not find it to be startling. CONCLUSION: Drivers who are familiar with CASs benefit from, and feel it is appropriate to generate, multiple alerts in a multiple-conflict scenario. APPLICATION: The results may inform the design of CASs for connected and automated vehicles.

27442741|t|Driver Injuries in Auto Road Racing.
27442741|a|In brief: The author reviewed the incidence and pattern of injuries sustained by drivers over a nine-year period at Mid-Ohio and Waterford Hills (Michigan) road-racing courses. One death occurred at Mid-Ohio, and eight drivers incurred major injuries. No fatalities occurred at Waterford Hills, but three drivers incurred major injuries. The racing stock sedan was the type of car most frequently involved in accidents in the professional group and the open-wheel car in the amateur group. The most common cause of injury was hitting the steel guardrail. Thus, improvements in corner construction and barrier design may improve track safety in auto road racing.

7412232|a|Simulated frontal, lap-shoulder belted, barrier impact tests were performed using a Volvo sedan and General Motors Hybrid III anthropomorphic test dummy. Swedish field accident injury data for this vehicle are available from another published study. For the purpose of this program, the injuries were logically subdivided into four body regions: head, neck, thorax, and lower torso. The Hybrid III has instrumentation in each of these regions. The results of three replicated tests at barrier equivalent velocities of nominally 32 and 48 km/h are discussed in terms of the field injuries, thereby providing a basis for more intelligent interpretation of future Hybrid III test results.

11706349|t|Factors influencing the patterns of injuries and outcomes in car versus car crashes compared to sport utility, van, or pick-up truck versus car crashes: Crash Injury Research Engineering Network Study.
11706349|a|BACKGROUND: Data using crash dummies suggest that motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) involving passenger sedans (S) vs sport utility, vans, or light trucks (SUVTs) produce more severe injuries than those involving two sedans (SvS). However, no detailed data regarding pattern of injuries or force mechanisms involved have been presented in real patients. METHODS: The relationship of injury patterns and severities with MVC reconstruction data were obtained in 412 MVC patients, drivers or front seat passengers. Crashes were examined with regard to impact direction, frontal (F) or lateral (L) crashes, vehicle mass ratio, ISS, DELTA V, seat belt use, and airbag deployment (AB). RESULTS: In 309 F-MVC, AB reduced overall ISS (24.3 to 17.9) with a reduction in the mean severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) GCS < or = 12, from 48% to only 28%. This AB protection from TBI was preserved as DELTA V increased to > 30 mph even though non-AB protected body areas (thorax, lung, liver, and lower extremity injuries) all increased. When vehicles of incompatible size and mass (SUVT) had F-MVC with sedans the incidence of severe TBI rose as did face lacerations despite AB or belt use. In L-MVC between SUVT and sedans compared with SvS MVC, there was a cephalad shift in body injuries with increased thorax, but decreased lower extremity injuries. The incidence of TBI increased. Analysis of injury contact sites (hits) showed more hits and a wider distribution of contract sites in SUVT vs sedan MVC. These appeared due to the greater mass excess and larger mass ratio, hood height, and width in the F-SUVT vs S crashes. All of these factors plus the increased bumper height above the body frame side-door sill were injury causal factors in the L-SUVT vs S MVCs. CONCLUSION: Both F and L crashes between sedans and SUVT with a high mass ratio shift the pattern of injury cephalad with increased thorax and intrathoracic organ injuries, and more severe TBI. These data suggest that improved head and thorax side-impact buffering and design features which transmit MVC forces from the higher front end of the larger mass SUVT to the frame of the sedan may better protect sedan occupants from side-impacts.

The two cars were identical except that one of the cars had all of the windows (except the windshield) tinted. The measured spectral erythemal UV on a horizontal plane with the windows fully closed was reduced in the tinted car by a factor of 42 when compared with the erythemal UV measured in the untinted car. The ambient UVA irradiances at various locations within four different makes of car and a tractor were also measured with a broad band UVA handheld meter. The average normalized daily UVA exposure (measured with a broad band UVA meter) was 1.3 times higher in a large family sedan when compared with that in a small hatchback and the UVA exposure in a car with tinted windows was 3.8 times less than in a similar untinted car.

15469535|t|Child booster seats and lethal seat belt injury.
15469535|a|A 7-year-old boy travelling in the rear seat of a sedan car was wearing a lap-shoulder seat belt and sitting on a booster seat. Following a collision the boy 'submarined' under the seat belt sustaining trauma to the anterior aspect of his neck, cardiac arrest and subsequent death from hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. This case demonstrates a potential problem with unsecured older-style booster seats. Movement of a seat in a collision may cause a child to slip under a seat belt and sustain significant neck injuries. Seatbelts for children must be correctly fitted, booster seats or capsules must be securely fastened and manufacturer's recommendations for size and weight limits should be followed. Unfortunately older booster seats may not have attached instructions for installation and use, may not fit later model vehicles, may not conform to current safety recommendations and may have worn webbing. For these reasons their use should be discouraged.

15319118|a|This study examined the performance of three rear-facing and two forward-facing child restraints (CRS) with three anchorage systems: standard seatbelt, LATCH (flexible) and ISOFIX (rigid). Frontal (64 km/h) and side impact (15 km/h) HyGe sled tests were conducted using a sedan buck. Overall, the preliminary findings suggested superior performance of rigid over seatbelt and flexible anchorages, particularly in side impacts. The results also suggest a need for design improvement for CRS with flexible anchorages to increase stability in side impacts. The findings have important implications for the proposed introduction of changes to Australian Standards for CRS to permit both flexible and rigid systems to coexist with conventional seatbelt anchorage systems.

19629809|a|Specifying comfortable driving postures is essential for ergonomic design and evaluation of a driver workspace. The present study sought to enhance and expand upon several existing recommendations for such postures. Participants (n = 38) were involved in six driving sessions that differed by vehicle class (sedan and SUV), driving venue (laboratory-based and field) or seat (from vehicles ranked high and low by vehicle comfort). Sixteen joint angles were measured in preferred postures to more completely describe driving postures, as were corresponding perceptual responses. Driving postures were found to be bilaterally asymmetric and distinct between vehicle classes, venues, age groups and gender. A subset of preferred postural ranges was identified using a filtering mechanism that ensured desired levels of perceptual responses. Accurate ranges of joint angles for comfortable driving postures, and careful consideration of vehicle and driver factors, will facilitate ergonomic design and evaluation of a driver workspace, particularly when embedded in digital human models.

"Dryer hose" tubing ran from the tailpipe into the rear window of his sedan. EMS providers also stated that a variety of unidentified pills were found on the floormat. There were no pill bottles in the vehicle or in the home to identify the medications. Whether the pills had been consumed was unclear. Ground EMS removed the patient from the vehicle and immediately placed the patient on high-flow oxygen. The duration of the exposure was unknown.

12595882|t|Measurement of volatile organic compounds inside automobiles.
12595882|a|The objective of the current study was to evaluate the types and concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the passenger cabin of selected sedan automobiles under static (parked, unventilated) and specified conditions of operation (i.e., driving the vehicle using air conditioning alone, vent mode alone, or driver's window half open). Data were collected on five different passenger sedan vehicles from three major automobile manufacturers. Airborne concentrations were assessed using 90-min time-weighted average (TWA) samples under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Method IP-1B to assess individual VOC compounds and total VOCs (TVOCs) calibrated to toluene. Static vehicle testing demonstrated TVOC levels of approximately 400-800 microg/m(3) at warm interior vehicle temperatures (approximately 80 degrees F), whereas TVOCs at least fivefold higher were observed under extreme heat conditions (e.g., up to 145 degrees F). The profile of most prevalent individual VOC compounds varied considerably according to vehicle brand, age, and interior temperature tested, with predominant compounds including styrene, toluene, and 8- to 12-carbon VOCs. TVOC levels under varied operating conditions (and ventilation) were generally four- to eightfold lower (at approximately 50-160 microg/m(3)) than the static vehicle measurements under warm conditions, with the lowest measured levels generally observed in the trials with the driver's window half open. These data indicate that while relatively high concentrations of certain VOCs can be measured inside static vehicles under extreme heat conditions, normal modes of operation rapidly reduce the inside-vehicle VOC concentrations even when the air conditioning is set on recirculation mode.

26890318|t|Can new passenger cars reduce pedestrian lower extremity injury? A review of geometrical changes of front-end design before and after regulatory efforts.
26890318|a|OBJECTIVE: Pedestrian lower extremity represents the most frequently injured body region in car-to-pedestrian accidents. The European Directive concerning pedestrian safety was established in 2003 for evaluating pedestrian protection performance of car models. However, design changes have not been quantified ever since. The goal of this study was to investigate front-end profiles of representative passenger car models and the potential influence on pedestrian lower extremity injury risk. METHODS: The front-end styling of sedan and SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) released from 2008 to 2011 was characterized by the geometrical parameters related to pedestrian safety and was compared to the representative car models before 2003. Influence of geometrical design change on the resultant risk of injury to pedestrian lower extremity, i.e., knee ligament rupture and long bone fracture, was estimated by a previously developed assessment tool assuming identical structural stiffness. Based on response surface generated from simulation results of a human body model (HBM), the tool provided kinematic and kinetic responses of pedestrian lower extremity resulted from a given car's front-end design. RESULTS: Newer passenger cars exhibited more "flat" front-end design. The median value of the sedan models provided 87.5  mm less bottom depth, and the SUV models exhibited 94.7  mm less bottom depth. In the lateral impact configuration similar to that in the regulatory test methods, these geometrical changes tend to reduce the injury risk of human knee ligament rupture by 36.6% and 39.6% based on computational approximation. The geometrical changes didn't influence the long bone fracture risk significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reviewed the geometrical changes of car front-end along with the regulatory concern on pedestrian safety. A preliminary quantitative benefit of the lower extremity injury reduction was estimated based on these geometrical features. Towards a comprehensive understanding of the role that car designs play in pedestrian protection, further investigation is recommended on the structural changes and inclusion of more accident scenarios.

26891186|t|Repeatability of a dynamic rollover test system.
26891186|a|OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to characterize the rollover crash and to evaluate the repeatability of the Dynamic Rollover Test System (DRoTS) in terms of initial roof-to-ground contact conditions, vehicle kinematics, road reaction forces and vehicle deformation. METHODS: Four rollover crash tests were performed on two pairs of replicate vehicles (two sedan tests and two compact multi-purpose van (MPV) tests), instrumented with a custom inertial measurement unit to measure vehicle and global kinematics and string potentiometers to measure pillar deformation time histories. The road was instrumented with load cells to measure reaction loads and an optical encoder to measure road velocity. Laser scans of pre- and post-test vehicles were taken to provide detailed deformation maps. RESULTS: Initial conditions were found to be repeatable, with the largest difference seen in drop height of 20mm while roll rate, roll angle, pitch angle, road velocity, drop velocity, mass, and moment of inertia were all 7% different or less. Vehicle kinematics (roll rate, road speed, roll and pitch angle, global Z' acceleration, and global Z' velocity) were similar throughout the impact, however differences were seen in the sedan tests because of a vehicle fixation problem and differences were seen in the MPV tests due to an increase in reaction forces during leading side impact likely caused by disparities in roll angle (3   difference) and mass properties (2.2% in MOI, 53.5mm difference in CG location). CONCLUSIONS: Despite those issues, kinetic and deformation measures showed a high degree of repeatability which is necessary for assessing injury risk in rollover as roof strength positively correlates with injury risk (Brumbelow, 2009). Improvements of the test equipment and matching mass properties will ensure highly repeatable initial conditions, vehicle kinematics, kinetics, and deformations.

26436234|t|Constrained Laboratory vs. Unconstrained Steering-Induced Rollover Crash Tests.
26436234|a|OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate how well an in-laboratory rollover crash test methodology that constrains vehicle motion can reproduce the dynamics of unconstrained full-scale steering-induced rollover crash tests in sand. METHODS: Data from previously-published unconstrained steering-induced rollover crash tests using a full-size pickup and mid-sized sedan were analyzed to determine vehicle-to-ground impact conditions and kinematic response of the vehicles throughout the tests. Then, a pair of replicate vehicles were prepared to match the inertial properties of the steering-induced test vehicles and configured to record dynamic roof structure deformations and kinematic response. RESULTS: Both vehicles experienced greater increases in roll-axis angular velocities in the unconstrained tests than in the constrained tests; however, the increases that occurred during the trailing side roof interaction were nearly identical between tests for both vehicles. Both vehicles experienced linear accelerations in the constrained tests that were similar to those in the unconstrained tests, but the pickup, in particular, had accelerations that were matched in magnitude, timing, and duration very closely between the two test types. Deformations in the truck test were higher in the constrained than the unconstrained, and deformations in the sedan were greater in the unconstrained than the constrained as a result of constraints of the test fixture, and differences in impact velocity for the trailing side. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that in-laboratory rollover tests can be used to simulate the injury-causing portions of unconstrained rollover crashes. To date, such a demonstration has not yet been published in the open literature. This study did, however, show that road surface can affect vehicle response in a way that may not be able to be mimicked in the laboratory. Lastly, this study showed that configuring the in-laboratory tests to match the leading-side touchdown conditions could result in differences in the trailing side impact conditions.

27622843|t|Overestimation of on-road air quality surveying data measured with a mobile laboratory caused by exhaust plumes of a vehicle ahead in dense traffic areas.
27622843|a|UNASSIGNED: The unintended influence of exhaust plumes emitted from a vehicle ahead to on-road air quality surveying data measured with a mobile laboratory (ML) at 20-40  km  h(-1) in dense traffic areas was investigated by experiment and life-sized computational fluidic dynamics (CFD) simulation. The ML equipped with variable sampling inlets of five columns by four rows was used to measure the spatial distribution of CO2 and NOx concentrations when following 5-20  m behind a sport utility vehicle (SUV) as an emitter vehicle equipped with a portable emission monitoring system (PEMS). The PEMS measured exhaust gases at the tailpipe for input data of the CFD simulations. After the CFD method was verified with experimental results of the SUV, dispersion of exhaust plumes emitted from a bus and a sedan was numerically analyzed. More dilution of the exhaust plume was observed at higher vehicle speeds, probably because of eddy diffusion that was proportional to turbulent kinetic energy and vehicle speed. The CO2 and NOx concentrations behind the emitter vehicle showed less overestimation as both the distance between the two vehicles and their background concentrations increased. If the height of the ML inlet is lower than 2  m and the ML travels within 20  m behind a SUV and a sedan ahead at 20  km  h(-1), the overestimation should be considered by as much as 200  ppb in NOx and 80  ppm in CO2. Following a bus should be avoided if possible, because effect of exhaust plumes from a bus ahead could not be negligible even when the distance between the bus and the ML with the inlet height of 2  m, was more than 40 m. Recommendations are provided to avoid the unintended influence of exhaust plumes from vehicles ahead of the ML during on-road measurement in urban dense traffic conditions.

10384231|t|Compatibility problems in frontal, side, single car collisions and car-to-pedestrian accidents in Japan.
10384231|a|Compatibility problems in car-to-car frontal, side, single car and car-to-pedestrian collisions in Japan are discussed using traffic accident data. The number of serious and fatal injuries is investigated for the subject car and other cars, which are categorized by their class and mass. The aggressivity of the cars is calculated by the number of fatalities, fatality rates and by the number of car registrations. The results show that in car-to-car frontal collisions, cars with a mass of 1150 kg are the most compatible among the current car population. In both car-to-car frontal and side collisions, the sports utility vehicle and mini car are found to be the most incompatible car types with high and low aggressivity, respectively. On the other hand, the accident data show that the wagon and midsize sedan are the most compatible car types. The compatibility of fixed objects in the road environment with cars and cars with pedestrians is also discussed. In a single car collision with a fixed object, the guardrail is the most compatible object and can reduce the fatality rate on prefecture roads by about 60%. The front geometry of the car has large effect on compatibility with a pedestrian.

15081726|t|Emissions from a vehicle fitted to operate on either petrol or compressed natural gas.
15081726|a|The purpose of this work was to evaluate the physical and chemical properties of emission products from a six-cylinder sedan car under a variety of operating conditions, before and after it has been converted to compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel. The specific focus of the measurements was on emission levels and characteristics of ultra fine particles and the emission levels together with the emissions of gaseous pollutants for a range of operating conditions before and up to 3 months after the vehicle was converted are presented and discussed in the paper. The investigations showed that converting a petrol operating vehicle to CNG has the potential of reducing some of the emissions and thus risks, while it does not appear to have an impact on others. In particular there was no statistically significant change in the emission of particles for the vehicle operating on petrol, before the conversion, compared to the emissions for the vehicle operating on CNG, after the conversion. There was a significant lowering of emissions of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and formaldehyde when the vehicle was operated on CNG, and a reduction of global warming potential was also observed when the vehicle was run on CNG, but the later gain is only at high vehicle speeds/loads, and would thus have to be considered in view of traffic and transport models for the region (in these models vehicle speed is an important parameter).

12214345|t|Comparison of seat belt force-limiting methods using the MADYMO multi-body/finite element program.
12214345|a|Belt force can be limited by a device in the belt retractor hardware or with force-limiting as an integral part of the webbing force/strain properties. In this research, MADYMO multi-body/finite element models of a 50th percentile Hybrid-3 male passenger in an airbag-equipped 4-door mid-size sedan were set up to compare occupant injury response under loading 1) from a baseline standard (non-force-limiting) belt system, 2) from a retractor-based force-limiting system, and 3) from a webbing-based force-limiting system. Chest acceleration was similar for the two force-limiting designs but the peak was approximately 10% greater for the standard belt. The magnitude of the head acceleration was similar for all three belts while the duration of these accelerations was much narrower for the force-limiting belts. Chest compression was similar for both force-limiting methods, and was about 60% less than the standard belt case. Compared to the baseline system and the retractor-based system, webbing-based force-limiting allowed greater pelvic excursion and a corresponding increase in femur force. It is concluded that webbing-based force limiting has some potential for reducing head and chest responses but these reductions must be evaluated with respect to other considerations such as submarining potential, non-frontal impact response, and future concepts like programmable force limiting.

15473913|t|A report of dangerously high carbon monoxide levels within the passenger compartment of a snow-obstructed vehicle.
15473913|a|BACKGROUND: We sought to determine how quickly carbon monoxide would accumulate in the passenger compartment of a snow-obstructed vehicle. METHODS: A 1992 sedan was buried in snow to the level of the undercarriage, the ignition was then engaged and carbon monoxide levels recorded at 2.5-minute intervals. The primary outcome was the time at which a lethal carbon monoxide level was detected. Six trials were conducted: windows closed; windows open one inch; windows open 6 inches; windows closed and tailpipe swept clear of snow; windows closed and one cubic foot of snow removed around tailpipe; windows closed and tailpipe completely cleared of snow to ground level in a path 12 inches wide. RESULTS: Lethal levels of carbon monoxide occurred within 2.5 minutes in the vehicle when the windows were closed, within 5 minutes when the widows were opened one inch, and within 7.5 minutes when the widows were opened six inches. Dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide were detected within the vehicle when the tailpipe had been swept clear of snow and when a one cubic foot area had been cleared around the tailpipe. When the tailpipe was completely unobstructed the carbon monoxide level was zero. CONCLUSIONS: Lethal levels of carbon monoxide occurred within minutes in this snow-obstructed vehicle.

15960097|t|Design and evaluation of a prototype rear obstacle detection and driver warning system.
15960097|a|This study, concerned with the development of driver interface criteria for a rear obstacle detection system, assessed the appropriateness of alternative warning timing algorithms and evaluated various interface approaches for presenting warning information to drivers. Interface testing used a minivan and a passenger sedan equipped with a prototype rear obstacle detection system. Two different warning timing algorithms and four different interface conditions were examined. The appropriateness of the warning timing algorithms was tested using an alerted backing procedure wherein drivers backed to known obstacles and braked in response to the warning. A surprise event scenario was also included in order to examine driver reaction to the warning under unexpected conditions. Alerted backing results suggest that although both timing algorithms led to few target strikes, one algorithm led to more acceptable ratings, fewer target strikes and close calls, and less urgent braking. None of the interface warning conditions reliably induced avoidance braking under the surprise event condition. Actual or potential applications of this work include the appropriate design of effective backing warning systems.

19085167|t|Rear seat occupant safety: kinematics and injury of PMHS restrained by a standard 3-point belt in frontal crashes.
19085167|a|Very little experimental research has focused on the kinematics, dynamics, and injuries of rear-seated occupants. This study seeks to develop a baseline response for rear-seated post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) in frontal crashes. Three PMHS sled tests were performed in a sled buck designed to represent the interior rear-seat compartment of a contemporary mid-sized sedan. All occupants were positioned in the right-rear passenger seat and subjected to simulated frontal crashes with an impact speed of 48 km/h. The subjects were restrained by a standard, rear seat, 3-point seat belt. The response of each subject was evaluated in terms of whole-body kinematics, dynamics, and injury. All the PMHS experienced excessive forward translation of the pelvis resulting in a backward rotation of the torso at the time of maximum forward excursion. The three subjects experienced maximum normalized chest deflections of 30%, 45%, and 30%, respectively, and maximum 3 ms clip resultant chest accelerations of 50, 42, and 52 g, respectively. Additionally, each PMHS received at least 13 rib fractures (maximum of 29 fractures), and flexion-tension induced neck injuries initiating in the lower cervical spine (C4-T1). The neck trauma ranged from ligament damage (AIS 1) to complete cervical spine transection (AIS 5).

25178069|t|Safety assessment characteristics of pedestrian legform impactors in vehicle-front impact tests.
25178069|a|This study investigated the characteristics of safety assessment results of front-area vehicle impact tests carried out using the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) legform impactor and a flexible legform impactor (FLEX legform impactor). Different types of vehicles (sedan, sport utility vehicle, high-roof K-car, and light cargo van) were examined. The impact locations in the study were the center of the bumper and an extremely stiff structure of the bumper (i.e., in front of the side member) of each tested vehicle. The measured injury criteria were normalized by injury assessment reference values of each legform impactor. The test results for center and side-member impacts indicated that there were no significant differences in ligament injury assessments derived from the normalized knee ligament injury measures between the TRL legform impactor and the FLEX legform impactor. Evaluations made using the TRL legform impactor and the FLEX legform impactor are thus similar in the vehicle safety investigation for knee ligament injury. Vehicle-center impact test results revealed that the tibia fracture assessments derived from the normalized tibia fracture measures did not significantly differ between the TRL legform impactor and the FLEX legform impactor. However, for an impact against an extremely stiff structure, there was a difference in the tibia fracture assessment between the FLEX legform impactor and the TRL legform impactor owing to their different sensor types.

23895977|t|Analysis of child-vehicle collision injuries by vehicle type.
23895977|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the severity of injuries to each body region of child pedestrians struck by different types of vehicles. METHODS: We collected in-depth data from the Institute for Traffic Accident Research and Data Analysis on pedestrians younger than 13 years with any bodily injuries from collisions with vehicles between 1993 and 2004. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients with a mean age of 6.9    2.4 years were included in the study. In collisions, vehicles caused higher Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) scores than those from impact with the road. Injury Severity Score and AIS values were higher with one-box or sports utility vehicles compared with those in sedan vehicles, but the differences were not statistically significant. The mean AIS score of head injuries was significantly higher with one-box or sports utility vehicles than that with sedans (1.6    2.1 vs 0.5    1.1, P < .05). The mean AIS score of the lower extremities was significantly higher with sedans than that with one-box or sports utility vehicles (1.2    1.0 vs 0.5    0.9, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The type and severity of injuries in child-car collisions vary by type of vehicle and pedestrian kinematics.

21572632|t|Atlantooccipital dislocation in motor vehicle side impact, derivation of the mechanism of injury, and implications for early diagnosis.
21572632|a|Numerous reports of atlantooccipital dislocations (AODs) have been described in frontal impacts and vehicle versus pedestrian collisions. Reports of survival after AOD in conjunction with side impacts have infrequently been reported in the literature. The objective of this study is to present a case of an AOD from a side impact vehicle collision, and deduce the mechanism of injury. A clinical and biomechanical reconstruction of the collision was performed to investigate the mechanism of the dislocation. A 51-year-old female was traveling in a four-door sedan and sustained a side impact collision with a compact pickup truck. At the time of extrication, the patient was neurologically intact with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. After admittance to the hospital, the patient developed a decline in respiratory status, right mild hemiparesis, and left sixth-nerve palsy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) reconstructions indicated a craniocervical dislocation. Surgical fixation was performed and all extra-axial hemorrhaging was evacuated. At discharge, the patient was neurologically intact on the left side, had right mild hemiparesis, left sixth-nerve palsy, and minor dysarthria. Survival rates of AODs have recently been increasing. Morbidity is still more prevalent, however. Due to the variety of symptoms that accompany AODs and the inconsistency of diagnostic imaging techniques, a thorough history of the etiology may lead to increased clinical suspicion of this injury and further raise survival rates.

20207304|t|Thoracic spine injury after a high-speed motor vehicle crash.
20207304|a|In late October, a hospital-based flight team was activated at 9:30 pm for an approximately 30-year-old man involved in a high-speed motor vehicle crash into a tree. Per emergency medical services (EMS) documentation, flight service was requested for advanced airway management and rapid transport of the patient to a Level 1 trauma center. Ground transport was estimated at 60+ minutes, whereas actual flight time was less than 15 minutes. On the crew's arrival at the designated landing zone, they were escorted to an ambulance where a 100-kg man was immobilized on a stretcher. Because the landing area was at a remote location, the flight team did not witness the scene; however, the ground paramedic reported that the patient was the single-occupant driver of a small sedan. Given the extent of damage to the front and passenger side of the vehicle, it was determined that the patient was driving at a high rate of speed when he struck the tree. He required approximately 20 to 25 minutes of extrication. An empty bottle of zolpidem (Ambien) was found on the floor of the vehicle; the 30-day prescription had been filled approximately a week before the accident occurred.

26390396|t|Compensatory Neural Tract from Contralesional Fornical Body to Ipsilesional Medial Temporal Lobe in a Patient with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Report.
26390396|a|UNASSIGNED: The authors attempted to demonstrate the compensatory process for an injured fornical crus after mild traumatic brain injury, using follow-up diffusion tensor tractography. A 50-yr-old female patient had a mild traumatic brain injury resulting from a collision that occurred while driving a sedan that was hit from the side. The patient complained of memory impairment since the onset of head trauma and underwent neuropsychologic evaluation at 2 mos after onset with global memory: 77 (6%ile) on the Memory Assessment Scale. She underwent rehabilitation, including cognitive therapy and cholinergic drugs until 12 mos after onset. At that time, she showed improvement of memory impairment with global memory: 90 (25%ile) on the Memory Assessment Scale. On 2-mo diffusion tensor tractography, a discontinuation was observed in the left fornical crus. By contrast, on 12-mo diffusion tensor tractography, the left discontinued fornical crus was shortened; instead, a neural tract from the right fornical body extended to the left medial temporal lobe via the splenium of the corpus callosum and the left fornical column was elongated to the left medial temporal lobe. The authors report on a patient who showed a compensatory neural tract from the contralesional fornical body to the ipsilesional medial temporal lobe via the corpus callosum after mild traumatic brain injury.

26397198|t|The influence of gait stance on pedestrian lower limb injury risk.
26397198|a|UNASSIGNED: The effect of pedestrian gait on lower limb kinematics and injuries has not been analyzed. The purpose of this paper was therefore to investigate the effect of pedestrian gait on kinematics and injury risk to the lower limbs using the Total Human Model for Safety adult male pedestrian model together with FE models of vehicle front structures. The modeling results indicate that the tibia and femur cortical bone von-Mises stress and the lateral knee bending angle of an adult pedestrian are strongly dependent on the gait stance when struck by both a sedan car and an SUV at 40km/h. The gait analysis shows that generally the leg of an adult pedestrian has lower injury risk when the knee is flexed and linear regressions show high negative correlation between knee flexion angle during impact and knee lateral bending angle and also high negative correlation between lower leg axial rotation during impact and knee lateral bending angle. Furthermore, in some gait stances a self-contact between the legs occurs, and the peak bones stresses and knee shearing displacement in the leg are then increased. Assessment of pedestrian lower limb injury should take account of these gait stance effects.

27056605|t|[Pedestrian head injury biomechanics and damage mechanism. Pedestrian protection automotive regulation assessment].
27056605|a|INTRODUCTION: Pedestrian-vehicle collisions are a leading cause of death among motor vehicle accidents. Recently, pedestrian injury research has been increased, mostly due to the implementation of European and Japanese regulations. This research presents an analysis of the main head injury vehicle sources and injury mechanisms observed in the field, posteriorly the data are compared with the current pedestrian regulations. METHODS: The analysis has been performed through an epidemiologic transversal and descriptive study, using the Pedestrian Crash Data Study (PCDS) involving 552 pedestrians, sustaining a total of 4.500 documented injuries. RESULTS: According to this research, the hood surface is responsible for only 15,1% of all the head injuries. On the other hand, the windshield glazing is responsible for 41,8%. In case of sedan vehicles the head impact location exceeds what is expected in the current regulation, and therefore no countermeasures are applied. From all the head injuries sustained by the pedestrians just 20% have the linear acceleration as isolated injury mechanism, 40% of the injuries are due to rotational acceleration. CONCLUSIONS: In this research, the importance of the rotational acceleration as injury mechanism, in case of pedestrian-vehicle collision is highlighted. In the current pedestrian regulation just the linear acceleration is addressed in the main injury criteria used for head injury prediction.

26218752|t|Comparison of multibody and finite element human body models in pedestrian accidents with the focus on head kinematics.
26218752|a|OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare and evaluate the difference in head kinematics between the TNO and THUMS models in pedestrian accident situations. METHODS: The TNO pedestrian model (version 7.4.2) and the THUMS pedestrian model (version 1.4) were compared in one experiment setup and 14 different accident scenarios where the vehicle velocity, leg posture, pedestrian velocity, and pedestrian's initial orientation were altered. In all simulations, the pedestrian model was impacted by a sedan. The head trajectory, head rotation, and head impact velocity were compared, as was the trend when various different parameters were altered. RESULTS: The multibody model had a larger head wrap-around distance for all accident scenarios. The maximum differences of the head's center of gravity between the models in the global x-, y-, and z-directions at impact were 13.9, 5.8, and 5.6 cm, respectively. The maximum difference between the models in head rotation around the head's inferior-superior axis at head impact was 36  . The head impact velocity differed up to 2.4 m/s between the models. The 2 models showed similar trends for the head trajectory when the various parameters were altered. CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in kinematics between the THUMS and TNO pedestrian models. However, these model differences are of the same magnitude as those induced by other uncertainties in the accident reconstructions, such as initial leg posture and pedestrian velocity.

3156953|t|Category differentiation in object recognition: typicality constraints on the basic category advantage.
3156953|a|When people are asked to decide whether an object is in a given category, they generally respond faster when the category is at the basic level (e.g., car) than when it is at the superordinate level (e.g., vehicle) or the subordinate level (e.g., sedan). Basic categories have shorter and more frequent names, are learned earlier, and are usually more highly differentiated than other categories (they are both specific and distinctive), but it is not clear which of these factors is responsible for the faster response to basic categories. In three experiments with natural language categories, we found evidence that objects can be identified fastest as members of differentiated categories, even when such categories have longer names and are learned later than less differentiated categories. Specifically, we argued that atypical subordinate categories (e.g., racing car) are highly differentiated and should therefore be responded to as fast as basic categories in object recognition. The results supported this view and also ruled out the hypothesis that objects are necessarily identified as members of basic categories before further identification. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of category names as definite descriptions in discourse.

15133988|t|Multivariate head injury threshold measures for various sized children seated behind vehicle seats in rear impacts.
15133988|a|Government recommendations to place children into the rear areas of motor vehicles to avoid airbag induced injuries have been complicated by the fact that most adult occupied front seats will collapse into the rear area during rear-impacts, and thus pose another potentially serious injury hazard to rear-seated children. Many variables affect whether or not a front seat occupant will collapse into the rear child, and whether that interaction could be injurious to the child. For instance, the severity of rear impact, coupled with front and rear occupant sizes (mass and stature), and the level of front seat strength, all interrelate to influence whether or not a rear seated child is likely to be impacted and possibly injured. The most common types of child injuries in these instances are head and chest injuries. In this study, a "high-low" experimental method was employed with a multi-level "factorial analysis" technique to study "multivariate" biomechanics of child head injury potential determined from rear-seated 3 and 6 year-old child surrogates in different types of vehicle bodies mounted to a sled system. The sled-buck systems were towed rearward into crushable barriers that matched the crash pulses of the vehicle types being tested. Various sizes of adult surrogates (i.e. 50 kg up to 110 kg), seated in both the "typical" low strength "single recliner" collapsing type front seat (i.e. 3.2 kN) and a much stronger "belt-integrated" seat design (i.e. up to 14.5 kN), were tested in the two different "sled body-buck" set-ups at various impact levels (i.e. 22.5 to 50 kph). One set-up used a popular minivan vehicle body with "built-in booster" seats for the 3 year-old. The other used a 4-door family sedan vehicle body with the 6 year-old in a standard rear bench seat. The parameters of the tests enabled the experimental data to be combined into polynomial "head injury" functions of the independent variables so the "likelihood" of rear child head-injury potential could be "mapped" over ranges of the key parameters. Accident cases were compared with predictions to verify the methodology.

16756930|t|Relative risk of spinal cord injury in road crashes involving seriously injured occupants of light passenger vehicles.
16756930|a|Road crashes involving occupants of light passenger vehicles are the leading cause of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Confirming the results of an earlier study, this study showed that: in single vehicle car crashes in the country, the odds of SCI were nearly five times higher (4.7) for occupants of non-sedan type light passenger vehicles compared with sedans; in single vehicle rollover crashes in the country, the odds of SCI were nearly three times higher (2.8) in non-sedans compared with sedans; the odds of SCI were nearly five times higher (4.8) for sports utility vehicles (SUVs) compared with sedans. When the data from the earlier study was included in order to increase statistical power, it was found that when compared to sedans that did not roll, occupants of all types of light passenger vehicles had a statistically significant substantially higher likelihood of SCI when involved in rollover (sedans 7.5 times, SUVs 5.9 times and others 8.4 times). In addition, SUVs had a higher likelihood of SCI even when not involved in rollover (5.4 times). Vehicle designers and regulators need to give more attention to the prevention of vehicle rollover and the means to improve occupant protection in the event of rollover. This study should be extended nationally to gain a larger case series so that the SCI risk of particular vehicle configurations, considering other crash factors, can be more precisely quantified and characteristics for low occurrence of SCI identified.

18338299|t|Analysis of seating position and anthropometric parameters of pregnant Japanese drivers.
18338299|a|OBJECTIVE: An anthropometric study was performed to understand the quantitative characteristics of the seating posture of Japanese pregnant drivers. METHODS: Twenty pregnant women with a mean gestation of 31.4 +/- 1.9 weeks and 20 age-matched, non-pregnant women provided written informed consent to participate in this study. A mid-sized, sedan-type passenger vehicle was used for measurement. The subjects, wearing light clothing, sat in the driver's seat of the vehicle and fastened the seatbelt after adjusting the seat to their usual driving posture. Longitudinal displacement of the slide adjuster and the reclining angle of the seat back were measured, relative to the reference position. Seating posture was investigated by measuring the coordinates of the anthropometric datum points of the drivers (head, shoulder, hip joint, knee joint, and the clearance between the steering wheel and the upper torso). RESULTS: The mean horizontal clearance between the lower rim of the steering wheel and the abdomen of the pregnant women was 146 +/- 56 mm, significantly smaller than that of the non-pregnant women (251 +/- 51 mm), due to the protrusion of the abdomen. There was no significant difference in seat adjustment position between the two groups. The height of the pregnant women and the horizontal distance from the lower rim of the steering wheel to the abdomen showed a moderate linear correlation in the pregnant group (R2 = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to previous studies, the differences of longitudinal distance were found between American and Japanese subjects without significant differences of body heights, due to the difference of body weights and abdominal circumferences. This is the first report to analyze the seating position and anthropometric parameters of pregnant drivers in an Asian population.

17311165|t|Thoracic response of belted PMHS, the Hybrid III, and the THOR-NT mid-sized male surrogates in low speed, frontal crashes.
17311165|a|Injury to the thorax is the predominant cause of fatalities in crash-involved automobile occupants over the age of 65, and many elderly-occupant automobile fatalities occur in crashes below compliance or consumer information test speeds. As the average age of the automotive population increases, thoracic injury prevention in lower severity crashes will play an increasingly important role in automobile safety. This study presents the results of a series of sled tests to investigate the thoracic deformation, kinematic, and injury responses of belted post mortem human surrogates (PMHS, average age 44 years) and frontal anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) in low-speed frontal crashes. Nine 29 km/h (three PMHS, three Hybrid III 50th% male ATD, three THOR-NT ATD) and three 38 km/h (one PMHS, two Hybrid III) frontal sled tests were performed to simulate an occupant seated in the right font passenger seat of a mid-sized sedan restrained with a standard (not force-limited) 3-point seatbelt. All occupants were instrumented to record deformation contours and accelerations of the thorax at multiple locations. The ATD subjects were also instrumented to record the internal deformation of the thorax via multi-point tracking systems. For the 29 km/h tests, PMHS maximum chest deflections ranged from 10% to 19% of the undeformed chest depth, and peak mid-spine accelerations ranged from 21 to 24 g. The average peak internal mid-sternal (sternum slider) deflections for the Hybrid III were 23 mm (29 km/h tests) and 30 mm (38 km/h tests). The average maximum Hybrid III sternal deflection of 23 mm measured in the 29 km/h tests corresponds to an AIS 3+ thoracic injury risk of 14% or greater for people 70 years and older. This result suggests that three-point belted elderly occupants without shoulder-belt force limiters could experience non-trivial thoracic injuries in frontal crashes that are below NHTSA's compliance and/or consumer information test severities.

19085175|t|A comparative analysis of the pedestrian injury risk predicted by mechanical impactors and post mortem human surrogates.
19085175|a|The objective of this study is to compare the risk of injury to pedestrians involved in vehicle-pedestrian impacts as predicted by two different types of risk assessment tools: the pedestrian subsystem impactors recommended by the European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) and post-mortem human surrogates (PMHS). Seven replicate full-scale vehicle-pedestrian impact tests were performed with PMHS and a mid-sized sedan travelling at 40 km/h. The PMHS were instrumented with six-degree-of-freedom sensor cubes and sensor data were transformed and translated to predict impact kinematics at the head center of gravity, proximal tibiae, and knee joints. Single EEVC WG 17/EuroNCAP adult headform, upper legform and lower legform impactor tests of the same vehicle were selected for comparison based on the proximity of their impact locations to that of the PMHS. The PMHS experienced higher HIC values (1830/2160) and lower impact velocities (8.5/7.5 m/s) than the impactor (1532 and 11.1 m/s) in impacts at the lower fourth of the windshield. The lower legform impactor (31 degrees) and PMHS (right: 25-40 degrees, and left: 24-39 degrees) predicted similar maximum knee bending angles. Some PMHS tibial accelerations (114-613 g) exceeded the proposed acceptance criteria (150-200 g) in both the absence and presence of distal tibial fracture, with the impactor predicting a similar result (335 g). The upper legform impactor test resulted in bending moments (361 Nm) and forces (6.3 kN) exceeding the acceptance criteria, while PMHS sustained pelvic injuries in 6 out of 7 tests.

19026231|t|Occupant restraint in the rear seat: ATD responses to standard and pre-tensioning, force-limiting belt restraints.
19026231|a|Recent studies have shown that restrained occupants over the age of 50 in frontal crashes have a higher risk of injury in the rear seat than in the front, and have hypothesized that the incorporation of technology such as belt pre-tensioning and force limiting preferentially in the front seat is at least partially responsible for this trend. This study investigates the potential benefits and trade-offs of seat belt pretensioners and force-limiters in the rear seat using a series of frontal impact sled tests at two speeds (48 km/h and 29 km/h DeltaV) with a buck representing the interior of the reat seat occupant compartment of a contemporary mid-sized sedan. Four different dummies were tested: the Hybrid III six year old (in a booster seat, H3 6YO), the Hybrid III 5(th) percentile female (H3 AF05), the Hybrid III 50(th) percentile male (H3 AM50), and the THOR-NT. The restraints consisted of either a standard three point belt, or a 3-point belt with a retractor pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter (FL+PT). Each test condition was repeated in triplicate. The FL+PT restraints (compared to the standard restraints) resulted in a significant (p < or = 0.05) decrease in peak internal chest deflection for each of the Hybrid III dummies at both test speeds (48 km/h: 29% decrease for H3 6YO, 38% decrease for H3 AF05, 30% decrease for H3 AM50), and for the THOR-NT at a DeltaV of 29 km/h. At 48 km/h, the FL+PT restraint qualitatively decreased the average peak internal chest deflection of the THOR-NT, however this decrease was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Furthermore, the FL+PT system allowed little or no increase in forward head excursion, and improved whole-body kinematics for all dummies by restricting pelvic excursion and slightly increasing torso pitch. The results suggest that the FL+PT system studied here may provide injury-reducing benefit to rear seat occupants in moderate to high severity frontal crashes, although more study is needed to evaluate these restraints in other crash scenarios.

19452371|t|Viscoelastic response of the thorax under dynamic belt loading.
19452371|a|OBJECTIVE: Three postmortem human surrogates (PMHS) were positioned and rigidly mounted through the spine to a tabletop test fixture for the purpose of characterizing thoracic response to diagonal belt loading with well-defined boundary conditions. METHODS: These PMHS were mounted to a stationary apparatus that supported the spine and shoulders in a configuration comparable to that seen in a 48 km/h automobile sled test at the time of maximum chest deformation. A belt restraint was positioned across the anterior torso with attachments at D-ring and buckle locations based on the geometry of a mid-sized sedan. The belt was attached to a trolley driven by a hydraulic ram linked to a universal test machine. Ramp and hold experiments were conducted at rates of 0.5, 0.9, and 1.2 m/s and hold times of 60 s. Ramp-hold displacement waveforms of up to 20 percent of the chest depth were applied to the chest while the resulting belt loads and spinal reaction loads were recorded. These data were used to identify parameters in a seven-parameter thoracic structural model mathematically analogous to a viscoelastic material model. A final test with 40 percent deflection was performed at the completion of the loading sequence. RESULTS: Model fits to ramps of different magnitudes indicated that the assumption of temporal linearity was reasonable over the range of inputs in this study. In agreement with previous studies, the spatial (force-deflection) response was only slightly nonlinear, indicating that a fully linear model would be reasonable up to the deflection levels used here. CONCLUSIONS: Pronounced variability in the instantaneous elastic behavior was observed among the three test subjects, whereas the relaxation behavior exhibited less variability.

23731627|t|Effects of child restraint system features on installation errors.
23731627|a|This study examined how child restraint system (CRS) features contribute to CRS installation errors. Sixteen convertible CRS, selected to include a wide range of features, were used in volunteer testing with 32 subjects. Subjects were recruited based on their education level (high or low) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in the right-rear passenger seat of a 2006 Pontiac G6 sedan using a crash dummy as a child surrogate. Each subject installed two CRS forward-facing (FF), one with LATCH and one with the vehicle seatbelt, and two CRS rear-facing (RF), one with LATCH and one with the seatbelt. After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 42 factors for each installation, such as choice of belt routing path, tightness of installation, and harness snugness. Analyses used linear mixed models to identify CRS installation outcomes associated with CRS features. LATCH connector type, LATCH strap adjustor type, and the presence of belt lockoffs were associated with the tightness of the CRS installation. The type of harness shoulder height adjuster was associated with the rate of achieving a snug harness. Correct tether use was associated with the tether storage method. In general, subject assessments of the ease-of-use of CRS features were not highly correlated with the quality of their installation, suggesting a need for feedback with incorrect installations. The data from this study provide quantitative assessments of some CRS features that were associated with reductions in CRS installation errors. These results provide child restraint designers with design guidelines for developing easier-to-use products. Research on providing effective feedback during the child restraint installation process is recommended.

23758277|t|Care related and transit neuronal injuries after cervical spine trauma: state of care and practice in Nigeria.
23758277|a|Suboptimal care during extraction and transfer after spinal trauma predisposes patients to additional spinal cord injury. This study examines the factors that contribute to care related and transit injuries and suggests steps to improve standard of care in spinal trauma patients in Nigeria. It is a questionnaire-based prospective study of patients admitted with cervical cord injury to two neurosurgical centers in Enugu, Nigeria, between March 2008 and October 2010. Demography, mechanism of injury, mode of extraction from the scene and transportation to first visited hospital, precautions taken during transportation, and treatment received before arriving at the neurosurgical unit were analyzed. There were 53 (77.9%) males, the mean age was 33.9 years, and 23.5% had concomitant head injury. Average delay was 3.5 h between trauma and presentation to initial care and 10.4 days before presentation to definitive care. Only 26.5% presented primarily to tertiary centers with trauma services. About 94.1% were extracted by passersby. None of the patients received cervical spine protection either during extrication or in the course of transportation to initial care, and 35.3% were sitting in a motor vehicle or supported on a motorbike during transport. Of the 43 patients transported lying down, 41.9% were in the back seat of a sedan, and only 11.8% were transported in an ambulance. Neurological dysfunction was first noticed after removal from the scene by 41.2% of patients, while 7.4% noticed it on the way to or during initial care. During subsequent transfer to definitive centers, only 36% had cervical support, although 78% were transported in ambulances. Ignorance of pre-hospital management of cervically injured patients exists in the general population and even among medical personnel and results in preventable injuries. There is need for urgent training, provision of paramedical services, and public enlightenment.

24435732|t|Risks of pedestrian serious injuries and fatalities associated with impact velocities of cars in car-versus-pedestrian accidents in Japan.
24435732|a|The first purpose of this study is to clarify the relation between the car impact velocity and pedestrian injury severity or mortality risk. We investigated the frequency of serious injuries and fatalities of pedestrians using vehicle-pedestrian accident data from the database of the Institute for Traffic Accident Research and Data Analysis (ITARDA) in Japan. The vehicle types considered are sedans, minivans, and box vans (ordinary automobiles) and light passenger cars and light cargo vans (light automobiles). The results revealed that a 10-km/h reduction in impact velocity could mitigate severe pedestrian injuries in cases involving impact velocities of 40 km/h or more for the five vehicle types analyzed. Specifically, if the impact velocity was 30 km/h or less, the frequency of serious injuries was less than 27% and the frequency of fatalities was less than 5% for the five vehicle types. Therefore, if the collision damage mitigation braking system (CDMBS) that uses a sensor to detect pedestrians can effectively reduce the impact velocity for various vehicle types, pedestrian injuries will be greatly mitigated. The second purpose of this study is to identify the factors that affect injury risk. Impact experiments were conducted in which a sedan impacted against a pedestrian full-scale dummy at 40 km/h and a pedestrian headform impactor was impacted against a road surface. The results indicated that the risk of pedestrian serious injury was significantly affected by multiple impact conditions, such as the pedestrian height, car impact velocity, car frontal shape, and car stiffness in cases where the car impacted the pedestrian's head, the degrees of influence of which were driven by the vehicle impact velocity.

24279923|t|Assessment of vehicle and restraint design changes for mitigating rear seat occupant injuries.
24279923|a|OBJECTIVE: Investigate the combined effects of belt geometry, seat substructure, and seat belt pretensioners and load limiters on rear seat occupant injury risk. METHODS: An instrumented Hybrid III 5th percentile adult female dummy was subjected to simulated frontal impacts (/\v = 45.8 km/h, peak acceleration = 27.1 g). Testing was conducted on a rear seat of a typical family sedan with modifications allowing for adjustment in upper anchorage position, mounting of an antisubmarining seat pan, and the use of seat belt pretensioners with load limiters. RESULTS: Dummy seated posture had the strongest effect on submarining. Seat belt pretensioners with load limiters reduced head and femur excursion and decreased chest injury measurements but did not prevent submarining. The antisubmarining seat pan, on the other hand, prevented submarining in one case but could not prevent submarining with the dummy in a slouched posture. Upper anchorage position resulting in poor belt geometry was shown to increase both chest injury measures and submarining. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study demonstrate the importance of an upright seated posture and the potential benefits of including adjustable upper anchorages to allow good sash belt fit, antisubmarining seat pans, belt buckles positioned near the seat bight, and seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters for rear seat occupants. These data can be used to inform the design of a system of restraints to reduce injuries to rear seat occupants.

20544577|t|The frontal-impact response of a booster-seated child-size PMHS.
20544577|a|OBJECTIVES: This article presents the response of a child-size postmortem human subject using a booster seat in a series of three frontal impact sled tests. METHODS: A 54-year-old female cadaver was seated in a booster seat in the rear seat of a buck representing a mid-sized American sedan. Two different restraint systems (conventional belt and pretensioning, force-limiting belt) were used to run three simulated frontal impacts (one at 29 km/h, two at 48 km/h). Instrumentation included accelerometers rigidly mounted on relevant body landmarks as well as chest bands. Trajectories were assessed through high-speed video cameras. RESULTS: Specific focus was on the whole-body kinematics and resulting head trajectories under two different restraint conditions (booster seat and standard belt, booster seat and force-limiting pretensioning belt) in a rear seat environment. At 48 km/h, the pretensioning, force-limiting seat belt reduced the forward excursion of both the head (353 mm vs. 424 mm) and the h-point (120 mm vs. 152 mm) compared to the standard system. Maximum torso pitch was similar for both seat belts. CONCLUSIONS: A complete description of the outcome of the tests is presented in the article. These results suggest that the introduction of a pretensioning force limiting belt in the rear seat can be beneficial for small size occupants like children using booster seats.

20058550|t|Rear seat occupant safety: an investigation of a progressive force-limiting, pretensioning 3-point belt system using adult PMHS in frontal sled tests.
20058550|a|Rear seat adult occupant protection is receiving increased attention from the automotive safety community. Recent anthropomorphic test device (ATD) studies have suggested that it may be possible to improve kinematics and reduce injuries to rear seat occupants in frontal collisions by incorporating shoulder-belt force-limiting and pretensioning (FL+PT) technologies into rear seat 3-point belt restraints. This study seeks to further investigate the feasibility and potential kinematic benefits of a FL+PT rear seat, 3-point belt restraint system in a series of 48 kmh frontal impact sled tests (20 g, 80 ms sled acceleration pulse) performed with post mortem human surrogates (PMHS). Three PMHS were tested with a 3-point belt restraint with a progressive (two-stage) force limiting and pretensioing retractor in a sled buck representing the rear seat occupant environment of a 2004 mid-sized sedan. Instrumentation included belt tension load cells, accelerometers on the head and at multiple locations on the spine, and chestbands to measure the chest deformation contours in the transverse plane. The kinematics of the subjects were quantified using off-board, high-speed video. The results of these tests were then compared to matched PMHS tests, published in 2008, performed in the same environment with a standard (not-force limited, not pretensioning) 3-point belt restraint. The FL+PT restraint system resulted in significant (p<0.05) decreases in peak shoulder belt tension (average +/- standard deviation: 4.4 +/- 0.13 kN with the FL+PT belt, 7.8 +/- 0. 6 kN with the standard belt) and 3 ms-resultant, mid-spine acceleration (FL+PT: 34 +/- 3.8 g; standard belt: 44 +/- 1.4 g). The FL+PT tests also produced more forward torso rotation caused by decreased forward excursion of the pelvis and increased payout out of the shoulder belt by the force-limiter. These results support the previous ATD studies that suggest that it may be possible to improve the kinematics of rear seat occupants in this type of collision using a 3-point belt system with a shoulder belt retractor equipped with a two-stage force-limiter and pretensioner.

26660753|t|Whole-body Response for Pedestrian Impact with a Generic Sedan Buck.
26660753|a|UNASSIGNED: To serve as tools for assessing injury risk, the biofidelity of whole-body pedestrian impact dummies should be validated against reference data from full-scale pedestrian impact tests. To facilitate such evaluations, a simplified generic vehicle-buck has been recently developed that is designed to have characteristics representative of a generic small sedan. Three 40 km/h pedestrian-impact tests have been performed, wherein Post Mortem Human Surrogates (PMHS) were struck laterally in a mid-gait stance by the buck. Corridors for select trajectory measures derived from these tests have been published previously. The goal of this study is to act as a companion dataset to that study, describing the head velocities, body region accelerations (head, spine, pelvis, lower extremities), angular velocities, and buck interaction forces, and injuries observed during those tests. Scaled, transformed head accelerations exceeded 80 g prior to head contact with the windshield for two of the three tests. Head xaxis angular velocity exceeded 40 rad/s prior to head contact for all three tests. In all cases the peak resultant head velocity relative to the vehicle was greater than the initial impact speed of the vehicle. Corridors of resultant head velocity relative to the vehicle were also developed, bounded by the velocities observed in these tests combined with those predicted to occur if the PMHS necks were perfectly rigid. These results, along with the other kinematic and kinetic data presented, provide a resource for future pedestrian dummy development and evaluation.

26192955|t|The Effect of Upper Body Mass and Initial Knee Flexion on the Injury Outcome of Post Mortem Human Subject Pedestrian Isolated Legs.
26192955|a|UNASSIGNED: In the ECE 127 Regulation on pedestrian leg protection, as well as in the Euro NCAP test protocol, a legform impactor hits the vehicle at the speed of 40 kph. In these tests, the knee is fully extended and the leg is not coupled to the upper body. However, the typical configuration of a pedestrian impact differs since the knee is flexed during most of the gait cycle and the hip joint applies an unknown force to the femur. This study aimed at investigating the influence of the inertia of the upper body (modelled using an upper body mass fixed at the proximal end of the femur) and the initial knee flexion angle on the lower limb injury outcome. In total, 18 tests were conducted on 18 legs from 9 Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHS). The principle of these tests was to impact the leg at 40 kph using a sled equipped with 3 crushing steel tubes, the stiffness of which were representative of the front face of a European sedan (bonnet leading edge, bumper and spoiler). The mass of the equipped sled was 74.5 kg. The test matrix was designed to perform 4 tests in 4 configurations combining two upper body masses (either 0 or 3 kg) and two knee angles (0 or 20 degrees) at 40 kph (11m/s) plus 2 tests at 9 m/s. Autopsies were performed on the lower limbs and an injury assessment was established. The findings of this study were first that the increase of the upper body mass resulted in more severe injuries, second that an initial flexion of the knee, corresponding to its natural position during the gait cycle, decreased the severity of the injuries, and third that based on the injury outcome, a test conducted with no upper body mass and the knee fully extended was as severe as a test conducted with a 3 kg upper body mass and an initial knee flexion of 20  .

26442253|t|Car Transfer and Wheelchair Loading Techniques in Independent Drivers with Paraplegia.
26442253|a|Car transfers and wheelchair (WC) loading are crucial for independent community participation in persons with complete paraplegia from spinal cord injury, but are complex, physically demanding, and known to provoke shoulder pain. This study aimed to describe techniques and factors influencing car transfer and WC loading for individuals with paraplegia driving their own vehicles and using their personal WCs. Sedans were the most common vehicle driven (59%). Just over half (52%) of drivers place their right leg only into the vehicle prior to transfer. Overall, the leading hand was most frequently placed on the driver's seat (66%) prior to transfer and the trailing hand was most often place on the WC seat (48%). Vehicle height influenced leading hand placement but not leg placement such that drivers of higher profile vehicles were more likely to place their hand on the driver's seat than those who drove sedans. Body lift time was negatively correlated with level of injury and age and positively correlated with vehicle height and shoulder abduction strength. Drivers who transferred with their leading hand on the steering wheel had significantly higher levels of shoulder pain than those who placed their hand on the driver's seat or overhead. The majority of participants used both hands (62%) to load their WC frame, and overall, most loaded their frame into the back (62%) vs. the front seat. Sedan drivers were more likely to load their frame into the front seat than drivers of higher profile vehicles (53 vs. 17%). Average time to load the WC frame (10.7   s) was 20% of the total WC loading time and was not related to shoulder strength, frame weight, or demographic characteristics. Those who loaded their WC frame into the back seat had significantly weaker right shoulder internal rotators. Understanding car transfers and WC loading in independent drivers is crucial to prevent shoulder pain and injury and preserve community participation.

26308123|t|Restraint use in motor vehicle crash fatalities in children 0 year to 9 years old.
26308123|a|BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in child passenger safety legislation and equipment, motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) continue to be the leading cause of death in children younger than 10 years. The objective of this study was to describe factors associated with restraint use in fatal MVC in children 0 year to 9 years old. METHODS: The Fatality Analysis Reporting System, maintained by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, was used to obtain data on MVC fatalities from 2001 to 2010 in children 0 year to 9 years old. The main outcome was restraint use. Demographic information (age, sex, and race) and crash characteristics including vehicle type (sedan, van, truck, sports utility vehicle) and seat position in the vehicle were analyzed with the    statistic to evaluate these factors for any restraint use compared with no restraint use in MVC fatalities. RESULTS: There were 7,625 MVC fatalities in children 0 year to 9 years old from 2001 to 2010.Among these fatalities, 4,041 (53%) had any restraint use. Front seat passengers accounted for 20.9% (1,595 of 7,625) of the fatalities. Children 0 year to 3 years old had a higher proportion of restraint use than children 4 years to 9 years old (p < 0.001). White children compared with black children had higher use of restraints (p < 0.001). Children riding in sedans/vans compared with sport utility vehicles/trucks and those riding in the rear seats of the vehicle compared with those in front seats were significantly more likely to use restraints (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, only half of children 0 year to 9 years old who died in an MVC were wearing any child restraint in the vehicle, and 20% were sitting in the front seat. Continued efforts must be made to enforce legislation and educate the public about best practices regarding child passenger safety to improve proper restraint use and to decrease MVC fatalities in children. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic/epidemiologic study, level II.

8126396|t|Children's hypotheses about word meanings: is there a basic level constraint?
8126396|a|We tested the hypothesis that a basic level constraint guides preschool children's hypotheses about word meanings. In the first study, a puppet labeled pictures with novel words. Three-, four-, and five-year-olds then chose referents for the novel word from a set of pictures. A pretest allowed us to select three sets of items for each subject: items that were familiar at the subordinate and basic level (e.g., poodle-dog), items that were familiar at the basic level but not at the subordinate level (e.g., sedan-car), and items that were unfamiliar at both levels (e.g., manta-ray). Contrary to the basic level constraint hypothesis, children tended to interpret novel words (e.g., quadruped) at the basic level only for items where they already knew a basic level name. In a second study, using a simplified procedure, three- and four-year-olds again showed no bias toward basic level interpretations except when translation to familiar basic level words was possible. A third study controlled for the possibility that our use of multisyllabic words might have biased children against basic level interpretations; despite the use of single-syllable nonsense words, children in this study again did not favor basic level interpretations. In the final two studies, adults' ratings of picture similarity and children's judgments in a triad task confirmed that the differences in children's basic level biases could not be accounted for by differences in similarity across the item types. Taken together these results suggest that although other constraints on word meaning may be in place, preschoolers are flexible in interpreting new words at different hierarchical levels.

15995010|t|Heat stress from enclosed vehicles: moderate ambient temperatures cause significant temperature rise in enclosed vehicles.
15995010|a|OBJECTIVE: Each year, children die from heat stroke after being left unattended in motor vehicles. In 2003, the total was 42, up from a national average of 29 for the past 5 years. Previous studies found that on days when ambient temperatures exceeded 86 degrees F, the internal temperatures of the vehicle quickly reached 134 to 154 degrees F. We were interested to know whether similarly high temperatures occurred on clear sunny days with more moderate temperatures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of temperature rise and rate of rise in similar and lower ambient temperatures. In addition, we evaluated the effect of having windows "cracked" open. METHODS: In this observational study, temperature rise was measured continuously over a 60-minute period in a dark sedan on 16 different clear sunny days with ambient temperatures ranging from 72 to 96 degrees F. On 2 of these days, additional measurements were made with the windows opened 1.5 inches. Analysis of variance was used to compare how quickly the internal vehicle temperature rose and to compare temperature rise when windows were cracked open 1.5 inches. RESULTS: Regardless of the outside ambient temperature, the rate of temperature rise inside the vehicle was not significantly different. The average mean increase was 3.2 degrees F per 5-minute interval, with 80% of the temperature rise occurring during the first 30 minutes. The final temperature of the vehicle depended on the starting ambient temperature, but even at the coolest ambient temperature, internal temperatures reached 117 degrees F. On average, there was an approximately 40 degrees F increase in internal temperature for ambient temperatures spanning 72 to 96 degrees F. Cracking windows open did not decrease the rate of temperature rise in the vehicle (closed: 3.4 degrees F per 5 minutes; opened: 3.1 degrees F per 5 minutes or the final maximum internal temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Even at relatively cool ambient temperatures, the temperature rise in vehicles is significant on clear, sunny days and puts infants at risk for hyperthermia. Vehicles heat up rapidly, with the majority of the temperature rise occurring within the first 15 to 30 minutes. Leaving the windows opened slightly does not significantly slow the heating process or decrease the maximum temperature attained. Increased public awareness and parental education of heat rise in motor vehicles may reduce the incidence of hyperthermia death and improve child passenger safety.

23683145|t|Frontal impact response for pole crash scenarios.
23683145|a|OBJECTIVE: Vehicle impacts with fixed roadside structures, such as poles, constitute a significant portion of road fatalities in North America. The purpose of this study was to evaluate occupant response in pole crash scenarios and compare the current vehicle kinematic-based injury metrics to occupant-based metrics to determine whether the vehicle metrics are representative of the injury levels sustained by an occupant. METHODS: To better understand vehicle and occupant response during impact with a pole, frontal crash scenarios with 3 common pole types (a rigid pole, a rigid pole with a frangible base, and a deforming or energy-absorbing pole) were investigated at various impact velocities. A numerical model of a Hybrid III human surrogate was integrated with a numerical model of a mid-size sedan, including improvements to the vehicle and seat models, and implementation of an air bag and restraint system. The vehicle model was validated using the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) frontal crash data for varying impact velocities into a rigid wall. A numerical model of a high-energy-absorbing pole was developed and validated, along with a rigid pole and a previously developed breakaway pole, to examine the effects of pole compliance on the vehicle and occupant response. Occupant response was investigated at varying impact velocities with the poles aligned with the vehicle centerline. Offset impacts were then investigated with the energy-absorbing pole aligned with the driver-side crush structure. RESULTS: The vehicle kinematic response metrics currently used to evaluate poles were compared to the currently accepted occupant injury response metrics and it was found, in general, that the occupant-based injury criteria predicted lesser injury than the vehicle kinematic response metrics for the same impact scenario. Specifically, the occupant impact velocity provided trends that differed from all other metrics. This can be attributed in part to the improvement in vehicle safety systems not accounted for by the vehicle-based metrics. CONCLUSIONS: For the same impact scenario, the breakaway pole resulted in the lowest predicted injury metrics for the vehicle occupant but was noted to be a potential threat to pedestrians and other nearby road users. The rigid pole resulted in the highest occupant injury predictions, whereas the energy-absorbing steel pole resulted in injury metrics below the threshold values, controlled the vehicle deceleration, and detached from the base only at higher velocity impacts. Appropriate evaluation of energy-absorbing poles requires consideration of the occupant response in addition to the current kinematic criteria.

24316501|t|Injury prediction in a side impact crash using human body model simulation.
24316501|a|BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of the occupant loading conditions in real world crashes is critical for injury prevention and new vehicle design. The purpose of this study was to develop a robust methodology to reconstruct injuries sustained in real world crashes using vehicle and human body finite element models. METHODS: A real world near-side impact crash was selected from the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) database. An average sedan was struck at approximately the B-pillar with a 290 degree principal direction of force by a lightweight pickup truck, resulting in a maximum crush of 45 cm and a crash reconstruction derived Delta-V of 28 kph. The belted 73-year-old midsized female driver sustained severe thoracic injuries, serious brain injuries, moderate abdominal injuries, and no pelvic injury. Vehicle finite element models were selected to reconstruct the crash. The bullet vehicle parameters were heuristically optimized to match the crush profile of the simulated struck vehicle and the case vehicle. The Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS) midsized male finite element model of the human body was used to represent the case occupant and reconstruct her injuries using the head injury criterion (HIC), half deflection, thoracic trauma index (TTI), and pelvic force to predict injury risk. A variation study was conducted to evaluate the robustness of the injury predictions by varying the bullet vehicle parameters. RESULTS: The THUMS thoracic injury metrics resulted in a calculated risk exceeding 90% for AIS3+ injuries and 70% risk of AIS4+ injuries, consistent with her thoracic injury outcome. The THUMS model predicted seven rib fractures compared to the case occupant's 11 rib fractures, which are both AIS3 injuries. The pelvic injury risk for AIS2+ and AIS3+ injuries were 37% and 2.6%, respectively, consistent with the absence of pelvic injury. The THUMS injury prediction metrics were most sensitive to bullet vehicle location. The maximum 95% confidence interval width for the mean injury metrics was only 5% demonstrating high confidence in the THUMS injury prediction. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a variation study methodology in which human body models can be reliably used to robustly predict injury probability consistent with real world crash injury outcome.

21050596|t|An inflatable belt system in the rear seat occupant environment: investigating feasibility and benefit in frontal impact sled tests with a 50(th) percentile male ATD.
21050596|a|Frontal-impact airbag systems have the potential to provide a benefit to rear seat occupants by distributing restraining forces over the body in a manner not possible using belts alone. This study sought to investigate the effects of incorporating a belt-integrated airbag ("airbelt") into a rear seat occupant restraint system. Frontal impact sled tests were performed with a Hybrid III 50th percentile male anthropomorphic test device (ATD) seated in the right-rear passenger position of a 2004 mid-sized sedan buck. Tests were performed at 48 km/h (20 g, 100 ms acceleration pulse) and 29 km/h (11 g, 100 ms). The restraints consisted of a 3-point belt system with a cylindrical airbag integrated into the upper portion of the shoulder belt. The airbag was tapered in shape, with a maximum diameter of 16 cm (at the shoulder) that decreased to 4 cm at the mid-chest. A 2.5 kN force-limiter was integrated into the shoulder-belt retractor, and a 2.3 kN pretensioner was present in the out-board anchor of the lap belt. Six ATD tests (three 48 km/h and three 29 km/h) were performed with the airbelt system. These were compared to previous frontal-impact, rear seat ATD tests with a standard (not-force-limited, not-pretensioned) 3-point belt system and a progressive force-limiting (peak 4.4 kN), pretensioning (FL+PT) 3-point belt system. In the 48 km/h tests, the airbelt resulted in significantly less (p<0.05, two-tailed Student's t-test) posterior displacement of the sternum towards the spine (chest deflection) than both the standard and FL+PT belt systems (airbelt: average 13  1.1 mm standard deviation; standard belt: 33  2.3 mm; FL+PT belt: 23  2.6 mm). This was consistent with a significant reduction in the peak upper shoulder belt force (airbelt: 2.7  0.1 kN; standard belt: 8.7  0.3 kN; FL+PT belt: 4.4  0.1 kN), and was accompanied by a small increase in forward motion of the head (airbelt: 54  0.4 cm; standard belt: 45  1.3 cm; FL+PT belt: 47  1.1 cm) The airbelt system also significantly reduced the flexion moment in the lower neck (airbelt: 169  3.3 Nm; standard belt: 655  26 Nm; FL+PT belt: 308  19 Nm). Similar results were observed in the 29 km/h tests. These results suggest that this airbelt system may provide some benefit for adult rear seat occupants in frontal collisions, even in relatively low-speed impacts. Further study is needed to evaluate this type of restraint system for different size occupants (e.g., children), for out-of-position occupants, and with other occupant models (e.g., cadavers).

20184830|t|The effect of obesity on the restraint of automobile occupants.
20184830|a|As obesity rates increase, the protection of obese occupants will become increasingly important in vehicle and restraint design. As a first step in this effort, this study seeks to compare the kinematics, dynamics, and injuries of obese post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) to (approximately) 50(th) percentile adult male PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pre-tensioning restraint system. Forty-eight km/h, frontal impact sled tests were performed with a sled buck representing the rear seat occupant compartment of a 2004 mid-sized sedan. The restraint system consisted of a 3-point belt with a pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter at the retractor. The test subjects were either obese PMHS or approximately 50(th) percentile adult male PMHS. Instrumentation included accelerometer packages on the spine. Deformation of the subjects' chests were measured using chestbands placed nominally at the superior-inferior locations of the 4(th) and 8(th) ribs. Tension in the restraint system was measured at the upper shoulder belt, lower shoulder belt, and the lap belt. Motion of the head, shoulder, pelvis, and knee were recorded using high-speed video. Two obese PMHS (average mass 137 kg, average stature 186 cm) and three approximately mid-sized male PMHS (average mass 68 kg, average stature 176 cm) were tested. The obese PMHS exhibited significantly greater forward motion of the head and the pelvis compared to the mid-sized PMHS. The obese PMHS also exhibited backwards torso rotation at the time of maximum forward excursion, whereas the mid-sized PMHS did not. The obese PMHS exhibited average maximum chest compressions of approximately 44% (+/- 9% standard deviation) of their initial chest depths, and exhibited 26 g (+/- 2 g) average 3 ms clip maximum chest resultant acceleration. In comparison, the mid-sized PMHS exhibited averages of 29% (+/- 9%) maximum chest compression and 35 g (+/- 4 g) maximum 3 ms clip chest acceleration. The obese PMHS exhibited 7 and 2 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 3 and 2. The mid-sized PMHS exhibited 12, 2, and 17 rib fractures, with maximum chest AIS scores of 4, 1, and 4, respectively. This study is the first (to the authors' knowledge) to compare the kinematic, dynamic, and injury behaviors of obese and mid-sized PMHS in frontal impact sled tests with a force-limiting, pretensioning restraint system. The unfavorable kinematics observed with the obese PMHS highlights the difficulty of designing restraint systems to adequately restrain obese occupants, even with currently available advanced restraint technologies.

21823948|t|Potential of pedestrian protection systems--a parameter study using finite element models of pedestrian dummy and generic passenger vehicles.
21823948|a|OBJECTIVE: To study the potential of active, passive, and integrated (combined active and passive) safety systems in reducing pedestrian upper body loading in typical impact configurations. METHODS: Finite element simulations using models of generic sedan car fronts and the Polar II pedestrian dummy were performed for 3 impact configurations at 2 impact speeds. Chest contact force, head injury criterion (HIC(15)), head angular acceleration, and the cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM(0.25)) were employed as injury parameters. Further, 3 countermeasures were modeled: an active autonomous braking system, a passive deployable countermeasure, and an integrated system combining the active and passive systems. The auto-brake system was modeled by reducing impact speed by 10 km/h (equivalent to ideal full braking over 0.3 s) and introducing a pitch of 1 degree and in-crash deceleration of 1 g. The deployable system consisted of a deployable hood, lifting 100 mm in the rear, and a lower windshield air bag. RESULTS: All 3 countermeasures showed benefit in a majority of impact configurations in terms of injury prevention. The auto-brake system reduced chest force in a majority of the configurations and decreased HIC(15), head angular acceleration, and CSDM in all configurations. Averaging all impact configurations, the auto-brake system showed reductions of injury predictors from 20 percent (chest force) to 82 percent (HIC). The passive deployable countermeasure reduced chest force and HIC(15) in a majority of configurations and head angular acceleration and CSDM in all configurations, although the CSDM decrease in 2 configurations was minimal. On average a reduction from 20 percent (CSDM) to 58 percent (HIC) was recorded in the passive deployable countermeasures. Finally, the integrated system evaluated in this study reduced all injury assessment parameters in all configurations compared to the reference situations. The average reductions achieved by the integrated system ranged from 56 percent (CSDM) to 85 percent (HIC). CONCLUSIONS: Both the active (autonomous braking) and passive deployable system studied had a potential to decrease pedestrian upper body loading. An integrated pedestrian safety system combining the active and passive systems increased the potential of the individual systems in reducing pedestrian head and chest loading.

26436235|t|Assessment of Bilateral Thoracic Loading on the Near-Side Occupant Due to Occupant-to-Occupant Interaction in Vehicle Crash Tests.
26436235|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aims, by means of the WorldSID 50th percentile male, to evaluate thoracic loading and injury risk to the near-side occupant due to occupant-to-occupant interaction in combination with loading from an intruding structure. METHOD: Nine vehicle crash tests were performed with a 50th percentile WorldSID male dummy in the near-side (adjacent to the intruding structure) seat and a THOR or ES2 dummy in the far-side (opposite the intruding structure) seat. The near-side seated WorldSID was equipped with 6 + 6 IR-Traccs (LH and RH) in the thorax/abdomen enabling measurement of bilateral deflection. To differentiate deflection caused by the intrusion, and the deflection caused by the neighboring occupant, time history curves were analyzed. The crash tests were performed with different modern vehicles, equipped with thorax side airbags and inflatable curtains, ranging from a compact car to a large sedan, and in different loading conditions such as car-to-car, barrier, and pole tests. Lateral delta V based on vehicle tunnel acceleration and maximum residual intrusion at occupant position were used as a measurement of crash severity to compare injury measurements. RESULT: In the 9 vehicle crash tests, thoracic loading, induced by the intruding structure as well as from the far-side occupant, varied due to the size and structural performance of the car as well as the severity of the crash. Peak deflection on the thoracic outboard side occurred during the first 50  ms of the event. Between 70 to 150  ms loading induced by the neighboring occupant occurred and resulted in an inboard-side peak deflection and viscous criterion. In the tests where the target vehicle lateral delta V was below 30  km/h and intrusion less than 200  mm, deflections were low on both the outboard (20-40  mm) and inboard side (10-15  mm). At higher crash severities, delta V 35  km/h and above as well as intrusions larger than 350  mm, the inboard deflections (caused by interaction to the far-side occupant) were of the same magnitude or even higher (30-70  mm) than the outboard deflections (30-50  mm). CONCLUSION: A WorldSID 50th percentile male equipped with bilateral IR-Traccs can detect loading to the thorax from a neighboring occupant making injury risk assessment feasible for this type of loading. At crash severities resulting in a delta V above 35  km/h and intrusions larger than 350  mm, both the inboard deflection and VC resulted in high risks of Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 3+ injury, especially for a senior occupant.

26436236|t|Injuries in Full-Scale Vehicle Side Impact Moving Deformable Barrier and Pole Tests Using Postmortem Human Subjects.
26436236|a|OBJECTIVE: To conduct near-side moving deformable barrier (MDB) and pole tests with postmortem human subjects (PMHS) in full-scale modern vehicles, document and score injuries, and examine the potential for angled chest loading in these tests to serve as a data set for dummy biofidelity evaluations and computational modeling. METHODS: Two PMHS (outboard left front and rear seat occupants) for MDB and one PMHS (outboard left front seat occupant) for pole tests were used. Both tests used sedan-type vehicles from same manufacturer with side airbags. Pretest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) images were obtained. Three-point belt-restrained surrogates were positioned in respective outboard seats. Accelerometers were secured to T1, T6, and T12 spines; sternum and pelvis; seat tracks; floor; center of gravity; and MDB. Load cells were used on the pole. Biomechanical data were gathered at 20 kHz. Outboard and inboard high-speed cameras were used for kinematics. X-rays and CT images were taken and autopsy was done following the test. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2005 scoring scheme was used to score injuries. RESULTS: MDB test: male (front seat) and female (rear seat) PMHS occupant demographics: 52 and 57 years, 177 and 166 cm stature, 78 and 65 kg total body mass. Demographics of the PMHS occupant in the pole test: male, 26 years, 179 cm stature, and 84 kg total body mass. Front seat PMHS in MDB test: 6 near-side rib fractures (AIS = 3): 160-265 mm vertically from suprasternal notch and 40-80 mm circumferentially from center of sternum. Left rear seat PMHS responded with multiple bilateral rib fractures: 9 on the near side and 5 on the contralateral side (AIS = 3). One rib fractured twice. On the near and contralateral sides, fractures were 30-210 and 20-105 mm vertically from the suprasternal notch and 90-200 and 55-135 mm circumferentially from the center of sternum. A fracture of the left intertrochanteric crest occurred (AIS = 3). Pole test PMHS had one near-side third rib fracture. Thoracic accelerations of the 2 occupants were different in the MDB test. Though both occupants sustained positive and negative x-accelerations to the sternum, peak magnitudes and relative changes were greater for the rear than the front seat occupant. Magnitudes of the thoracic and sternum accelerations were lower in the pole test. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use PMHS occupants in MDB and pole tests in the same recent model year vehicles with side airbag and head curtain restraints. Injuries to the unilateral thorax for the front seat PMHS in contrast to the bilateral thorax and hip for the rear seat occupant in the MDB test indicate the effects of impact on the seating location and restraint system. Posterolateral locations of fractures to the front seat PMHS are attributed to constrained kinematics of occupant interaction with torso side airbag restraint system. Angled loading to the rear seat occupant from coupled sagittal and coronal accelerations of the sternum representing anterior thorax loading contributed to bilateral fractures. Inward bending initiated by the distal femur complex resulting in adduction of ipsilateral lower extremity resulted in intertrochanteric fracture to the rear seat occupant. These results serve as a data set for evaluating the biofidelity of the WorldSID and federalized side impact dummies and assist in validating human body computational models, which are increasingly used in crashworthiness studies.

27586114|t|Non-censored rib fracture data during frontal PMHS sled tests.
27586114|a|OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to obtain non-censored rib fracture data due to three-point belt loading during dynamic frontal post-mortem human surrogate (PMHS) sled tests. The PMHS responses were then compared to matched tests performed using the Hybrid-III 50(th) percentile male ATD. METHODS: Matched dynamic frontal sled tests were performed on two male PMHSs, which were approximately 50(th) percentile height and weight, and the Hybrid-III 50(th) percentile male ATD. The sled pulse was designed to match the vehicle acceleration of a standard sedan during a FMVSS-208 40  kph test. Each subject was restrained with a 4  kN load limiting, driver-side, three-point seatbelt. A 59-channel chestband, aligned at the nipple line, was used to quantify the chest contour, anterior-posterior sternum deflection, and maximum anterior-posterior chest deflection for all test subjects. The internal sternum deflection of the ATD was quantified with the sternum potentiometer. For the PMHS tests, a total of 23 single-axis strain gages were attached to the bony structures of the thorax, including the ribs, sternum, and clavicle. In order to create a non-censored data set, the time history of each strain gage was analyzed to determine the timing of each rib fracture and corresponding timing of each AIS level (AIS = 1, 2, 3, etc.) with respect to chest deflection. RESULTS: Peak sternum deflection for PMHS 1 and PMHS 2 were 48.7  mm (19.0%) and 36.7  mm (12.2%), respectively. The peak sternum deflection for the ATD was 20.8  mm when measured by the chest potentiometer and 34.4  mm (12.0%) when measured by the chestband. Although the measured ATD sternum deflections were found to be well below the current thoracic injury criterion (63  mm) specified for the ATD in FMVSS-208, both PMHSs sustained AIS 3+ thoracic injuries. For all subjects, the maximum chest deflection measured by the chestband occurred to the right of the sternum and was found to be 83.0  mm (36.0%) for PMHS 1, 60.6  mm (23.9%) for PMHS 2, and 56.3  mm (20.0%) for the ATD. The non-censored rib fracture data in the current study (n = 2  PMHS) in conjunction with the non-censored rib fracture data from two previous table-top studies (n = 4  PMHS) show that AIS 3+ injury timing occurs prior to peak sternum compression, prior to peak maximum chest compression, and at lower compressions than might be suggested by current PMHS thoracic injury criteria developed using censored rib fracture data. In addition, the maximum chest deflection results showed a more reasonable correlation between deflection, rib fracture timing, and injury severity than sternum deflection. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data provide compelling empirical evidence that suggests a more conservative thoracic injury criterion could potentially be developed based on non-censored rib fracture data with additional testing performed over a wider range of subjects and loading conditions.

26998281|t|Effect of a traditional herbal medicine, hangekobokuto, on the sensation of a lump in the throat in patients with respiratory diseases.
26998281|a|UNASSIGNED: The sensation of a lump in the throat (SLT) is not a rarely encountered symptom. The etiology of SLT appears to be multifactorial, and the psychological characteristics, stress and pressure of a psychiatric disorder may be significant factors in SLT. Hangekobokuto, one of the traditional herbal medicines, is a known drug that has an effect on SLT. The efficacy of a short-term hangekobokuto treatment on SLT was evaluated. To assess whether a 2-week prescription of hangekobokuto improves SLT mainly in patients with respiratory diseases, a retrospective study was performed between April 2013 and August 2015. During the study period, a total of 43 patients were treated with hangekobokuto. Twelve (27.9%) of the 43 patients were reported to experience completely effective treatment (SLT completely disappeared), and 14 (32.6%) experienced moderately effective treatment (25-99% SLT disappeared). Patients with bronchial asthma and those without a medical history of respiratory disease exhibited a good response to hangekobokuto. No specific predictive factor of the response to hangekobokuto on SLT was identified in the multivariate regression analysis. Therefore, the present results suggested that hangekobokuto could be one of the treatment choices for uncontrolled SLT.

23413567|t|Efficient preparation of Hangekobokuto (Banxia-Houpo-Tang) decoction by adding perilla herb before decoction is finished.
23413567|a|Hangekobokuto (banxia-houpo-tang) is a Kampo (traditional Japanese) medicine used mostly for anxiety disorder and consists of Pinellia Tuber, Poria Sclerotium, Magnolia Bark, Perilla Herb and Ginger. Perilla Herb contains an essential oil rich in perillaldehyde, which has a pleasant flavor, but this is easily lost due to heating. We therefore investigated how the major constituents of hangekobokuto, namely perillaldehyde, rosmarinic acid, magnolol and [6]-gingerol, varied with time during decoction and approached an optimal condition for decoction. Rosmarinic acid at 15 min after boiling, and magnolol and [6]-gingerol at 30 min were mostly extracted, while 0.09 mg of perillaldehyde remained at 15 min, but was not detected at 30 min. From these results, a decoction was prepared by adding Perilla Herb 1, 2, 5 and 10 min prior to the termination time of decoction at 30 min. When Perilla Herb was added 1 min beforehand, perillaldehyde was abundant (1.58 mg) and the amount of rosmarinic acid was already the same as that in the conventional decoction at 30 min, but the amount of total extract was inadequate. When Perilla Herb was added 5 min beforehand, perillaldehyde remained to some extent (0.61 mg) and rosmarinic acid was significantly increased compared with that in the conventional decoction at 30 min. From these results, we can conclude that the decoction should be prepared by boiling for not more than 30 min and, if possible, Perilla Herb should be added 5 min prior to the termination time. Considering the antidepressant-like activity of perillaldehyde and rosmarinic acid, the suggested method will not only achieve better treatment for anxiety, but also provide an effective use of crude drugs in the resource-limited environment.
